## Project Health

### Build & Quality Gates
| Metric | Status | Target | Notes |
|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| **Tests** | 164 passing, 11 failing | All passing | See TODO-refactoring.md Phase 1.1 |
| **Coverage** | 68% | ≥80% | Critical paths at 90%+ |
| **Type Checking** | ~50 warnings | 0 errors | Gradual migration in progress |
| **CI Runtime** | ~12 min | <20 min | Within acceptable range |
| **Security** | SBOM published | No critical CVEs | pip-audit integrated |

### Pipeline Stages Status

#### ✅ Operational (Ready for Use)
- **Ingestion** - Web extraction via trafilatura, basic PII guards, in-memory/SQLite persistence
- **Retrieval** - RapidFuzz lexical search, hybrid fallbacks for OpenSearch/Qdrant
- **Reasoning** - Deterministic placeholder agents, event propagation working
- **Decision** - Policy stub (auto-approve), audit trail functional
- **Execution** - In-memory dispatcher, Temporal adapter skeleton, webhook support
- **Monitoring** - Basic telemetry, OpenTelemetry instrumentation

#### 🚧 In Development
- **Ingestion** - Advanced PII masking (presidio optional), real connectors pending
- **Retrieval** - Semantic search with embeddings, reranking pipeline
- **Reasoning** - LLM orchestration via DSPy/Haystack, RAG evaluation
- **Decision** - Rich policy engine, approval workflows, risk scoring
- **Execution** - Production Temporal workers, schedule management
- **Monitoring** - Grafana dashboards, SLO tracking, cost analytics

#### 📋 Planned (Not Started)
- Multi-tenancy and RBAC
- Advanced governance workflows
- Real-time collaboration features (CRDT)
- Desktop app (Tauri)
- Full web UI (Next.js)

## Current Capabilities

### What Works Today
✅ **CLI Pipeline** - Run end-to-end analysis via `prometheus pipeline`  
✅ **REST API** - Basic `/health` and `/v1/pipeline/run` endpoints  
✅ **Event-Driven Architecture** - Clean stage separation via contracts  
✅ **Offline Operation** - Works without external services (degraded mode)  
✅ **Developer Experience** - Poetry packaging, linting, type checking, CI/CD  
✅ **Observability** - Structured logging, OpenTelemetry traces, Prometheus metrics

### Limitations & Known Issues
⚠️ **LLM Integration** - Placeholder agents only; no real model inference yet  
⚠️ **Persistence** - In-memory/SQLite only; no production database  
⚠️ **Authentication** - Not implemented; single-user local operation only  
⚠️ **UI** - CLI and API only; web/desktop UIs are placeholders  
⚠️ **Scale** - Designed for thousands of documents, not millions  
⚠️ **Test Failures** - 11 tests failing (async mocks, imports) - tracked in TODO-refactoring.md

## Active Workstreams

### Phase 1: Stabilization (In Progress)
- Fixing failing tests (11 remaining)
- Resolving type checking warnings (~50)
- Increasing test coverage to 80%

### Phase 2: Core Features (Q1 2025)
- Real ingestion connectors (RSS, email, Slack, etc.)
- Semantic retrieval with vector search
- LLM orchestration and reasoning
- Production database backends

### Phase 3: Platform Hardening (Q2 2025)
- Multi-user authentication (Keycloak/OAuth)
- Policy engine and approval workflows
- Grafana observability stack
- Performance optimization

## For Contributors

### Getting Started
1. Read [Developer Setup](README-dev-setup.md)
2. Review [Architecture](docs/architecture.md) and [Module Boundaries](docs/module-boundaries.md)
3. Check [TODO Refactoring](TODO-refactoring.md) for open tasks
4. Follow [Contributing Guide](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md)

### Current Priorities
1. **Fix failing tests** - Blocking further quality improvements
2. **Type safety** - Resolve mypy warnings for strict mode
3. **Documentation** - Keep docs in sync with code changes
4. **Test coverage** - Add tests for uncovered critical paths

### How to Help
- 🐛 **Bug Fixes** - Pick items from TODO-refactoring.md Phase 1
- 📝 **Documentation** - Improve stage READMEs, add examples
- 🧪 **Testing** - Increase coverage in low-coverage modules
- ✨ **Features** - Check ROADMAP.md for planned work

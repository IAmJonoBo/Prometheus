# Architecture Refactoring Summary

**Date**: October 3, 2025  
**Lead**: Architecture Team  
**Status**: Phase 1 Complete ‚úÖ

## Executive Summary

This refactoring initiative assessed and enhanced the architectural quality of the
Prometheus Strategy OS. The codebase already exhibits strong modular design with
event-driven architecture, but lacked automated type checking, dependency validation,
and comprehensive documentation of boundaries.

## Deliverables

### 1. Type Checking Infrastructure ‚úÖ

- **`mypy.ini`**: Configured with strict mode for `common/` and gradual strictness
  for pipeline stages
- **CI Integration**: Added `quality-gates` job to validate types on every PR
- **Migration Plan**: Documented in ADR-0002 with phase-by-phase strictness increases

**Impact**:

- Type errors now caught before runtime
- Better IDE support and refactoring confidence
- Foundation for strict type safety across codebase

---

### 2. Dependency Analysis and Visualization ‚úÖ

- **`scripts/generate_dependency_graph.py`**: Automated tool to analyze module
  dependencies and detect cycles
- **`docs/dependency-graph.md`**: Generated Mermaid diagram showing module relationships
- **Cycle Detection**: Identified one acceptable circular dependency
  (`prometheus` ‚Üí `execution` ‚Üí `scripts` ‚Üí `prometheus` via runtime imports)

**Impact**:

- Clear visibility into module coupling
- Automated detection of architectural violations
- Foundation for enforcing dependency rules in CI

---

### 3. Module Boundaries Documentation ‚úÖ

- **`docs/module-boundaries.md`**: Comprehensive guide defining responsibilities,
  public APIs, and constraints for each module
- **`CODEOWNERS`**: Established ownership boundaries for code review
- **Dependency Rules**: Explicit allowed/forbidden dependency patterns

**Impact**:

- New contributors understand architecture quickly
- Code reviews can enforce boundaries
- Refactoring guided by explicit contracts

---

### 4. Quality Gates in CI ‚úÖ

- **Type Checking**: mypy runs on every PR (warnings only during migration)
- **Linting**: ruff enforces code style and best practices
- **Coverage**: pytest enforces 60% minimum (will increase to 80%)
- **Future Gates**: Ready to add performance budgets, security scans

**Impact**:

- Quality regressions caught automatically
- Consistent code style across team
- Test coverage tracked and enforced

---

### 5. Architectural Decision Records ‚úÖ

- **ADR-0002**: Documents type checking strategy, dependency management, and
  circular dependency analysis
- **Template**: Establishes ADR format for future decisions

**Impact**:

- Architectural decisions explicitly documented
- Context preserved for future maintainers
- Rationale available for questioning/revisiting

---

### 6. Staged Improvement Plan ‚úÖ

- **`TODO-refactoring.md`**: Detailed roadmap with 5 phases, owners, and acceptance
  criteria
- **Prioritization**: High-priority items (fix tests, type errors) clearly marked
- **Success Metrics**: Quantitative targets for coverage, test count, CI runtime

**Impact**:

- Clear path forward for remaining work
- Work can be parallelized across teams
- Progress trackable via metrics

---

## Key Findings

### Strengths üí™

1. **Clean Architecture**: Pipeline stages already communicate via immutable events
2. **No Problematic Cycles**: Only one runtime cycle (acceptable per ADR-0002)
3. **Strong Typing**: Extensive use of type hints (Python 3.12+ annotations)
4. **Test Coverage**: 68% overall, with critical paths >90%
5. **Observability**: Telemetry hooks present in all stages

### Areas for Improvement üîß

1. **Failing Tests**: 11 tests need fixing (async mocks, import errors)
2. **Type Errors**: ~50 mypy errors across pipeline modules
3. **Coverage Threshold**: Need to increase from 60% to 80% and enforce
4. **Performance Budgets**: Not yet defined or enforced
5. **Contract Testing**: Missing schema evolution validation

## Next Steps

### Immediate (High Priority)

1. **Fix Failing Tests** (2-4 hours)
   - 2 async mock issues in `test_schedules.py`
   - 3 CLI proxy issues
   - 6 import/signature errors

2. **Fix Type Errors** (4-8 hours)
   - ~50 mypy errors in pipeline modules
   - Remove unused type ignore comments
   - Add missing return type annotations

3. **Increase Coverage** (2-3 hours)
   - Threshold from 60% ‚Üí 80%
   - Test uncovered critical paths

### Short-term (1-2 weeks)

- Add performance budgets and benchmarks
- Add security scanning (pip-audit, Bandit, Semgrep)
- Add dependency drift monitoring

### Medium-term (1-2 months)

- Extract shared utilities to reduce duplication
- Introduce dependency injection for better testability
- Add contract testing for event schema evolution
- Add E2E integration tests with Docker Compose

### Long-term (3-6 months)

- Implement SLO/SLI monitoring and alerting
- Add cost tracking and optimization
- Complete API documentation and tutorials

## Recommendations

1. **Prioritize Test Fixes**: Blocking all other work; should be completed first
2. **Gradual Type Strictness**: Don't enable strict mode until errors are fixed
3. **Incremental Coverage**: Increase threshold by 5% per sprint to avoid churn
4. **Automate Everything**: Use CI to enforce all quality gates
5. **Document Decisions**: Update ADRs whenever architecture changes

## Acknowledgments

This refactoring builds on the strong foundation established by the Prometheus team.
The codebase already exhibits many best practices:

- Modular event-driven architecture
- Comprehensive type annotations
- Extensive test coverage
- Observability instrumentation

Our work focused on automating validation, documenting boundaries, and establishing
quality gates to maintain these standards as the codebase grows.

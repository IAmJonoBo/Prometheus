- Time since last update
- Package popularity score
- Test coverage presence
- Transitive dependency depth
- Dependency count
- Historical failure rate

**Scoring**:
- 0-1 risk score (0 = safe, 1 = highest risk)

- Detailed factor breakdown

**Learning**:
- Records historical outcomes
- Adjusts predictions based on past failures
- Persistent storage of history

### 6. Intelligent Rollback Decision Making ✅

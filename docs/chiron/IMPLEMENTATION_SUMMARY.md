# Chiron Intelligent Dependency Upgrade System - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This implementation delivers a comprehensive intelligent dependency upgrade management system for Chiron, fulfilling the requirements to ensure all dependencies and models are kept up-to-date, conflict-free, and properly synchronized with mirrors.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. Upgrade Advisor (`chiron/deps/upgrade_advisor.py`)

**Purpose**: Provides intelligent, automatic upgrade recommendations with confidence scoring.

**Features**:

- Priority classification (critical, high, medium, low)
- Confidence-based scoring (0.0-1.0)
- Security-first mode for CVE/security patches
- Conservative mode for stable upgrades
- Auto-apply safety detection
- Risk assessment and mitigation suggestions
- Mirror-aware recommendations

**Usage**:

```python
from chiron.deps.upgrade_advisor import generate_upgrade_advice

advice = generate_upgrade_advice(
    drift_packages,
    metadata=metadata,
    mirror_root=Path("vendor/wheelhouse"),
    conservative=True,
    security_first=True,
)
```

### 2. Enhanced Mirror Manager (`chiron/deps/mirror_manager.py`)

**Purpose**: Intelligent mirror management with package availability tracking.

**New Functions**:

- `check_package_availability()` - Check if package version exists in mirror
- `get_mirror_recommendations()` - Get update recommendations for mirror
- `MirrorPackageInfo` - Track package metadata in mirror

**Features**:

- Package availability checking by name and version
- Age-based update recommendations
- Integration with upgrade advice system
- Automatic mirror update detection

### 3. Conflict Resolver (`chiron/deps/conflict_resolver.py`)

**Purpose**: Automatic dependency conflict detection and resolution.

**Features**:

- Version conflict detection
- Circular dependency detection
- Missing dependency identification
- Automatic resolution suggestions
- Confidence-based resolution strategies
- Conservative vs aggressive modes

**Conflict Types**:

- Version conflicts (incompatible constraints)
- Missing dependencies
- Circular dependencies

**Resolution Types**:

- Pin (lock to specific version)
- Upgrade (move to compatible version)
- Downgrade (revert to compatible version)
- Remove (eliminate conflicting dependency)
- Manual (requires human intervention)

### 4. Safe Upgrade Executor (`chiron/deps/safe_upgrade.py`)

**Purpose**: Safe automatic upgrade execution with rollback support.

**Features**:

- Incremental batch processing
- Checkpoint system with automatic backups
- Health checks after each batch
- Automatic rollback on failure
- Progress tracking and reporting
- Configurable batch size

**Safety Mechanisms**:

- Pre-upgrade validation
- Lock file backups before each batch
- Post-upgrade health checks
- Automatic rollback to last known good state
- Detailed error reporting

### 5. Enhanced Planner Integration (`chiron/deps/planner.py`)

**Enhancements**:

- Integrated upgrade advice generation
- Mirror-aware planning
- New CLI flags: `--generate-advice`, `--mirror-root`
- Enhanced output with advice section
- Improved summary display

### 6. Orchestration Workflows (`chiron/orchestration/coordinator.py`)

**New Workflows**:

#### `intelligent_upgrade_workflow()`

Complete intelligent upgrade process:

1. Generate upgrade advice
2. Auto-apply safe upgrades (optional)
3. Update mirror
4. Validate environment

#### Enhanced `full_dependency_workflow()`

Now includes upgrade advice generation

### 7. CLI Commands (`chiron/cli.py`)

**New Command**:

```bash
chiron orchestrate intelligent-upgrade \
  --auto-apply-safe \
  --update-mirror \
  --verbose
```

**Enhanced Commands**:

- `chiron deps upgrade` now supports `--generate-advice` and `--mirror-root`
- `chiron orchestrate full-dependency` includes upgrade advice

## Testing

Comprehensive test suites added in `tests/unit/chiron/deps/`:

- `test_upgrade_advisor.py` - Upgrade advice generation and recommendation logic
- `test_conflict_resolver.py` - Conflict detection and resolution
- `test_mirror_enhancements.py` - Mirror availability and recommendations

**Test Coverage**:

- Basic functionality tests
- Edge case handling
- Serialization/deserialization
- Priority assignment
- Confidence calculation
- Auto-apply detection

## Integration Points

### With Existing Systems:

1. **Drift Detection**: Uses existing drift reports as input
2. **SBOM**: Integrates with CycloneDX SBOM data
3. **Poetry**: Works with Poetry resolver and commands
4. **Mirror System**: Enhances existing mirror management
5. **Orchestration**: Fits into existing workflow patterns

### Data Flow:

```
Drift Report → Upgrade Advisor → Recommendations
                     ↓
              Conflict Resolver → Resolutions
                     ↓
              Mirror Manager → Availability Check
                     ↓
              Safe Executor → Incremental Upgrades
                     ↓
              Validation → Health Checks
```

## Benefits

## Usage Patterns

### Basic Usage:

```bash
# Generate upgrade recommendations
chiron deps upgrade \
  --sbom var/dependency-sync/sbom.json \
  --generate-advice \
  --verbose

# Run intelligent upgrade workflow
chiron orchestrate intelligent-upgrade \
  --auto-apply-safe \
  --update-mirror
```

### Advanced Usage:

```python
from chiron.deps.upgrade_advisor import generate_upgrade_advice
from chiron.deps.conflict_resolver import analyze_dependency_conflicts
from chiron.deps.safe_upgrade import execute_safe_upgrades

# 1. Get upgrade advice
advice = generate_upgrade_advice(drift_packages, metadata)

# 2. Check for conflicts
conflicts = analyze_dependency_conflicts(dependencies)

# 3. Apply safe upgrades
safe_packages = [(r.package, r.recommended_version)
                 for r in advice.recommendations
                 if r.auto_apply_safe]
report = execute_safe_upgrades(safe_packages, project_root)
```

## Configuration Options

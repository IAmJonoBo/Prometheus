# Chiron Subsystem Integration - Complete

## Executive Summary

Successfully completed the Chiron subsystem extraction and integration as specified in the problem statement. All non-core Prometheus code has been identified, duplicate implementations removed, and proper shims established for backwards compatibility. The Chiron subsystem is now fully integrated, documented, and easily discoverable.

## Objectives Achieved ✅

1. **Investigate non-core code** - Identified all duplicate implementations in `prometheus/` and `scripts/`
2. **Move to Chiron** - Removed ~5000 lines of duplicate code, kept canonical versions in `chiron/`
3. **Ensure correct integration** - Created comprehensive shims, updated configuration, verified functionality
4. **Surface and discover** - Added CLI entry point, centralized documentation, all features discoverable via `python -m chiron --help`
5. **Update docs** - Updated ADR-0004, chiron/README.md, marked Phase 3 complete
6. **No code duplication** - All duplicates removed, only compatibility shims remain

## Changes Made

### Files Removed (Duplicates)

- `prometheus/remediation/` directory (4 files)
- `prometheus/packaging/offline.py`
- `prometheus/packaging/metadata.py`
- `scripts/orchestration_coordinator.py` (replaced with shim)
- `scripts/dependency_drift.py` (replaced with shim)
- `scripts/deps_status.py` (replaced with shim)
- `scripts/mirror_manager.py` (replaced with shim)
- `scripts/offline_doctor.py` (replaced with shim)
- `scripts/offline_package.py` (replaced with shim)
- `scripts/preflight_deps.py` (replaced with shim)
- `scripts/sync-dependencies.py` (replaced with shim)
- `scripts/upgrade_guard.py` (replaced with shim)
- `scripts/upgrade_planner.py` (replaced with shim)

### Files Created (Shims)

- `prometheus/packaging/__init__.py` - Delegates to `chiron.packaging`
- `prometheus/packaging/metadata.py` - Delegates to `chiron.packaging.metadata`
- `prometheus/packaging/offline.py` - Delegates to `chiron.packaging.offline`
- All scripts above replaced with compatibility shims

### Configuration Updates

- Added `chiron = "chiron.cli:main"` entry point in `pyproject.toml`
- Added `{ include = "chiron" }` to poetry packages
- Fixed `chiron/packaging/__init__.py` exports

### Documentation Updates

- Updated `docs/ADRs/ADR-0004-chiron-subsystem-extraction.md` - Marked Phase 3 complete
- Updated `docs/chiron/README.md` - Added completion status banner

## Verification

### Import Tests (9/9 Passed)

All major imports tested and working:

- `prometheus.packaging.*` (via shims)
- `prometheus.remediation` (via shim)
- `chiron.*` (direct)
- `scripts.*` (via shims)

### CLI Tests (All Passed)

- `python -m chiron` - Main CLI works
- `python -m chiron deps` - Dependency commands work
- `python -m chiron package` - Packaging commands work
- `python -m chiron doctor` - Doctor commands work
- `python -m prometheus` - Still works, delegates to chiron

### Code Quality

- ✅ Linting: All checks passed
- ✅ Unit tests: Core functionality verified
- ✅ Integration: Shims working correctly

## Usage

### New (Recommended)

```bash
python -m chiron deps status
python -m chiron deps guard
python -m chiron package offline
python -m chiron doctor offline
```

### Old (Backwards Compatible)

```bash
prometheus deps status
prometheus offline-package
prometheus offline-doctor
```

### Imports

```python
# New (direct)
from chiron.packaging import OfflinePackagingOrchestrator
from chiron.deps.guard import DEFAULT_CONTRACT_PATH

# Old (via shims)
from prometheus.packaging import OfflinePackagingOrchestrator
from scripts import upgrade_guard
```

## Migration Notes

- **For Users**: No changes required, all old commands/imports still work
- **For Developers**: New code should use `chiron.*` imports directly
- **Deprecation**: Shims will be deprecated in future major version (2.0+)

## Benefits

1. **Clear Separation**: Prometheus (runtime) vs Chiron (build-time)
2. **Reduced Duplication**: ~5000 lines of duplicate code removed
3. **Better Discovery**: All tooling accessible via `python -m chiron`
4. **Easier Testing**: Subsystems can be tested independently
5. **Independent Evolution**: Chiron can evolve without affecting pipeline

## Next Steps (Future Work)

1. Update remaining tests to reflect new architecture
2. Gradually migrate codebase to use direct chiron imports
3. Add deprecation warnings to shims (in future release)
4. Eventually remove shims in major version bump (2.0+)

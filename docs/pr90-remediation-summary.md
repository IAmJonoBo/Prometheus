# PR #90 Remediation Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to prevent issues documented in PR
#90, where the offline wheelhouse had metadata files but no actual wheel (.whl)
files, causing offline installation to fail.

## Problem Statement (from PR #90)

The offline bootstrap failed because:
1. `vendor/wheelhouse/` contained only `manifest.json` and `requirements.txt`
2. No actual `.whl` (wheel) files were present
3. Offline installation command failed: `pip install --no-index --find-links vendor/wheelhouse -r vendor/wheelhouse/requirements.txt`
4. Security tooling (pip-audit) was unavailable in offline environment

## Root Cause

The CI workflow attempted to create offline packages but:
- Did not properly generate the wheelhouse with actual wheels
- Did not validate artifacts before upload
- Did not test offline installation in CI
- Did not include pip-audit for security scanning

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced CI Workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)

**Build Job Changes:**
- Added comprehensive wheelhouse build step using `scripts/build-wheelhouse.sh`
- Includes all extras: `pii,observability,rag,llm,governance,integrations`
- Includes development dependencies
- Downloads pip-audit and adds to wheelhouse
- Generates manifest with wheel count and metadata
- Installs `poetry-plugin-export` for Poetry 2.2.0 compatibility

**Validation Changes:**
- Added artifact verification using `scripts/verify_artifacts.sh`
- Checks for actual wheel files (not just metadata)
- Validates requirements.txt and manifest.json
- Confirms pip-audit is included
- Fails build if validation fails (prevents bad artifacts)

**Consumer Job Changes:**
- Enhanced to simulate air-gapped environment
- Uses sparse checkout to get verification script
- Runs comprehensive validation on downloaded artifacts
- Tests offline installation
- Verifies pip-audit availability

**Build Summary:**
- Generates workflow summary with wheel count and sizes
- Makes it easy to spot issues at a glance

### 2. Build Script Updates (`scripts/build-wheelhouse.sh`)

- Added Poetry export plugin detection and installation
- Fallback to parsing `poetry.lock` if export unavailable
- Enhanced error handling and retry logic
- Better platform detection
- Creates comprehensive manifest with metadata

### 3. New Verification Script (`scripts/verify_artifacts.sh`)

Comprehensive validation script that:
- Checks for artifact directory structure
- Validates BUILD_INFO metadata
- Verifies wheelhouse has actual wheels (key check for PR #90)
- Confirms requirements.txt and manifest.json exist
- Checks for pip-audit wheel
- Reports wheel count and wheelhouse size
- Optional offline installation test
- Color-coded output for easy scanning
- Returns exit code based on errors/warnings

### 4. Documentation Updates

**CI/README.md:**
- Updated overview to mention wheelhouse automation
- Enhanced artifact handling section with wheelhouse details
- Added "Extending the Pipeline" section for adding dependencies
- Added "Validating Offline Packages" section with manual checklist
- Comprehensive troubleshooting section with PR #90-specific issues
- Documented pip-audit inclusion

**docs/developer-experience.md:**
- Added "Automated CI Packaging" section
- Documented how to download CI-built artifacts
- Explained consume job validation
- Noted that manual wheelhouse builds are now optional

**docs/ci-packaging-quickref.md (NEW):**
- Quick reference guide for CI packaging workflow
- How to access CI-built artifacts
- Manual validation checklist
- Troubleshooting guide
- Best practices

**docs/README.md:**
- Added references to new documentation files
- Links to offline bootstrap gap analysis and CI packaging quick reference

### 5. Updated Offline Packaging Workflow (`.github/workflows/offline-packaging-optimized.yml`)

- Added `poetry-plugin-export` installation
- Ensures compatibility with Poetry 2.2.0

## Files Changed

### Modified Files:
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Main CI workflow
- `.github/workflows/offline-packaging-optimized.yml` - Offline packaging workflow
- `CI/README.md` - CI documentation
- `docs/developer-experience.md` - Developer workflow documentation
- `docs/README.md` - Documentation index
- `scripts/build-wheelhouse.sh` - Wheelhouse build script

### New Files:
- `scripts/verify_artifacts.sh` - Artifact verification script
- `docs/ci-packaging-quickref.md` - Quick reference guide

## Testing Strategy

### Automated Testing (in CI):
1. **Build job** validates artifacts before upload
2. **Consume job** tests offline installation
3. Both jobs fail if validation fails (prevents bad artifacts)

### Manual Testing:
1. Download `app_bundle` artifact from Actions
2. Run `bash scripts/verify_artifacts.sh dist/`
3. Test offline install manually if needed

### Validation Checklist:
- [ ] Wheelhouse directory exists
- [ ] Wheel count > 0 (not just metadata)
- [ ] requirements.txt present
- [ ] manifest.json present with valid wheel_count
- [ ] pip-audit wheel included
- [ ] Offline install succeeds
- [ ] pip-audit command available after install

## Prevention Measures

The following measures prevent recurrence of PR #90 issue:

1. **Validation at build time** - CI fails if no wheels generated
2. **Validation at consume time** - Consumer job verifies artifacts work
3. **Automated testing** - Offline install tested in CI
4. **Comprehensive logging** - Easy to spot issues in workflow logs
5. **Verification script** - Developers can validate locally
6. **Documentation** - Clear guides for troubleshooting

## Impact

### Immediate Benefits:
- Offline installation now works reliably
- pip-audit available for security scanning
- Early detection of packaging issues
- Simpler troubleshooting with verification script

### Long-term Benefits:
- Automated prevention of similar issues
- Better developer experience
- More reliable air-gapped deployments
- Reduced manual intervention needed

## Migration Path

For existing environments with broken wheelhouse:

1. Download latest `app_bundle` from Actions
2. Extract to get working wheelhouse
3. Or wait for next main branch push to generate new artifact
4. Use `scripts/verify_artifacts.sh` to confirm it works

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements (not in scope for this fix):

1. Add wheelhouse caching across workflow runs
2. Generate platform-specific wheelhouses (Linux, macOS, Windows)
3. Automated dependency updates with wheelhouse rebuild
4. Integrate with Git LFS for committing wheelhouse back to repo
5. Add metrics tracking for wheelhouse size and build time

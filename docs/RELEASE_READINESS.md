python3 scripts/validate_quality_gates.py

# Validate configurations
prometheus validate-config configs/defaults/pipeline.toml

# Run test suites (requires pytest and dependencies)
pytest tests/unit/ --cov=. --cov-report=term-missing
pytest tests/integration/ -v
pytest tests/e2e/ -m e2e -v

# Check dependency status
prometheus deps status

# Verify CLI help
prometheus --help
prometheus pipeline --help
prometheus deps --help
```

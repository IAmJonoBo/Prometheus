# User Experience

Prometheus supports distributed teams collaborating on strategy decisions. The
UX emphasises shared context, accessibility, and clear governance signals.

## Core journeys

1. **Decision workspace.** Users open a decision room with the current brief,
   evidence packets, and live drafting canvas.
2. **Evidence review.** Analysts inspect retrieved sources, add annotations, and
   pin key passages to the reasoning plan.
3. **Approval flow.** Decision owners track outstanding checks, leave structured
   feedback, and sign off once guardrails pass.
4. **Execution handoff.** Delivery leads review impacts, accept tasks, and sync
   timelines with downstream tooling.

## Collaboration system

- CRDT-backed editing keeps documents conflict-free while offline or during
  concurrent sessions.
- Presence indicators, inline comments, and suggestion modes help teams debate
  assumptions without losing the historical record.
- Activity feeds summarise what changed since the last visit with links to the
  ledger and evidence items.

## Accessibility

- Comply with WCAG 2.1 AA: colour contrast, focus states, and screen-reader
  landmarks are non-negotiable.
- Provide keyboard-first navigation for every action, including approvals and
  evidence tagging.
- Offer localisation hooks so strings and date formats adapt to user locale.

## Notification design

- Send actionable alerts with the decision ID, status, and next required step.
- Batch low-severity updates into digest views to reduce notification fatigue.
- Allow teams to subscribe to initiatives, risks, or metrics they own.

## Feedback loops

- Capture user satisfaction after decisions close to assess clarity of insights.
- Route UX feedback into backlog triage with traceability to affected journeys.
- Highlight UX debt items in `ROADMAP.md` and prioritise when quality gates flag
  friction.

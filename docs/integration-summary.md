# Integration Summary: Packaging, Updates, Remediation, and CLI

## Problem Statement
The issue requested ensuring that packaging, library updating, remediation, auto-remediation, update orchestration, package checks, and the CLI all operate optimally together, both individually and as a whole.

## Changes Made

### 1. CLI Integration (`prometheus/cli.py`)

#### Added `offline-doctor` Command
- **Purpose**: Expose the offline doctor diagnostic tool through the unified CLI
- **Implementation**: Proxy pattern matching other CLI commands (offline-package, deps commands)
- **Usage**: `prometheus offline-doctor [options]`
- **Benefits**:
  - Consistent interface with other packaging/deps commands
  - No need to remember script paths
  - Integrated help system
  - Proper exit code handling

#### Enhanced Command Docstrings
- **offline-package**: Added workflow guidance pointing to offline-doctor
- **deps status**: Explained integration with offline-package
- **deps upgrade**: Showed complete workflow (status â†’ upgrade â†’ package)
- **deps guard**: Added context for CI validation
- **deps drift**: Explained monitoring use case
- **deps sync**: Connected to air-gapped packaging workflow

**Code Changes**:
```python
@app.command(
    name="offline-doctor",
    context_settings={"allow_extra_args": True, "ignore_unknown_options": True},
)
def offline_doctor(ctx) -> None:
    """Diagnose offline packaging readiness without mutating the repository.
    
    Validates tool availability, wheelhouse health, and configuration before
    running 'prometheus offline-package'. Supports --format json|table|text
    for different output styles.
    """
    from scripts import offline_doctor as doctor_cli
    argv = list(ctx.args)
    exit_code = doctor_cli.main(argv or None)
    if exit_code != 0:
        raise typer.Exit(exit_code)
```

### 2. Test Coverage (`tests/unit/prometheus/test_cli_proxies.py`)

Added three comprehensive tests for the offline-doctor CLI integration:

1. **test_offline_doctor_forwards_arguments**: Verifies argument passing
2. **test_offline_doctor_propagates_exit**: Ensures exit codes are preserved
3. **test_offline_doctor_without_arguments**: Tests default behavior

These follow the same patterns as existing proxy command tests (deps guard, deps drift, deps sync).

### 3. Comprehensive Workflow Documentation (`docs/packaging-workflow-integration.md`)

Created a **379-line** comprehensive guide covering:

#### Command Groups
- **Offline Packaging**: doctor, package
- **Dependency Management**: status, upgrade, guard, drift, sync

#### Detailed Command Reference
Each command documented with:
- Purpose and when to use it
- Complete usage examples
- Integration points with other commands
- Exit code semantics

#### 5 Recommended Workflows
1. **Pre-Packaging Health Check**: doctor â†’ package â†’ review
2. **Dependency Update Cycle**: status â†’ upgrade â†’ guard â†’ package â†’ doctor
3. **CI Integration Pattern**: Complete automation example
4. **Auto-Remediation Flow**: Using auto-update policies
5. **Troubleshooting Packaging Failures**: Diagnostic steps

#### Best Practices
- Always run doctor first
- Use status before upgrade
- Review auto-applied updates
- Keep contracts updated
- Automate in CI
- Version artifacts
- Monitor drift
- Document exceptions

### 4. Documentation Updates

#### `docs/offline-doctor-enhancements.md`
- Updated examples to show CLI usage as primary method
- Kept direct script invocation as alternative

#### `docs/offline-packaging-status.md`
- Updated "How to refresh the data" section
- Shows CLI command as recommended approach
- Provides direct script path for reference

#### `docs/developer-experience.md`
- Replaced single offline-package mention with comprehensive CLI overview
- Added bullet points for all major commands
- Referenced new packaging-workflow-integration.md

#### `README.md`
- Added new "Integrated CLI commands" section
- Showed offline packaging workflow examples
- Demonstrated dependency management commands
- Referenced detailed workflow documentation

### 5. Export List Update (`prometheus/cli.py`)
Added `offline_doctor` to the `__all__` export list for proper module visibility.

## Integration Benefits

### Individual Command Improvements
1. **offline-doctor**: Now accessible via unified CLI, consistent with other tools
2. **offline-package**: Enhanced docs show pre-flight checks with doctor
3. **deps status**: Clear integration with packaging workflow
4. **deps upgrade**: Complete workflow documented (before/after steps)
5. **deps guard**: CI/validation context clarified
6. **deps drift**: Monitoring use case explained
7. **deps sync**: Connection to air-gapped deployment shown

### Holistic Integration
1. **Unified Interface**: All commands accessible via `prometheus` CLI
2. **Clear Workflow**: doctor â†’ package â†’ status â†’ upgrade â†’ package (cycle)
3. **Documentation**: Single source of truth for workflows
4. **Consistency**: All proxy commands follow same pattern
5. **Discoverability**: `prometheus --help` shows all options
6. **Exit Codes**: Consistent handling across all commands
7. **Auto-remediation**: Package command integrates with auto-update policies
8. **Observability**: All deps commands emit telemetry

## Testing & Validation

### Test Coverage
- 3 new tests for offline-doctor CLI proxy
- Tests match existing patterns for other proxy commands
- Cover argument forwarding, exit code propagation, default behavior

### Documentation Validation
- All command examples tested for syntax
- Cross-references verified
- Consistent terminology throughout

### Code Quality
- Python syntax validated with py_compile
- Follows existing code patterns
- No duplication introduced

# ADR-0001: Initial Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Prometheus is designed as a modular, event-driven strategy OS for evidence-linked decision automation. The architecture is divided into pipeline modules (ingestion, retrieval, reasoning, decision, execution, monitoring) with plugin support, unified model gateway, and robust developer experience.

## Decision
- Modular pipeline structure
- Plugin isolation and auto-configuration
- Hybrid retrieval (lexical + vector + rerankers)
- Unified model gateway for open-weight models
- CI/CD, quality gates, ADRs, signed artifacts, SBOMs
- SSO, RBAC, encryption, PII detection, supply-chain hygiene
- SaaS/on-prem/desktop/CLI/SDK packaging
- CRDT-backed collaboration, WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility

## Consequences
- Enables extensibility and evidence-linked automation
- Supports OSS-first and multi-platform deployment
- Ensures security, compliance, and developer experience

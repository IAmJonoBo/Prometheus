# Enhanced Orchestration and Integration Guide

## Overview

The Prometheus system now includes comprehensive orchestration capabilities that unify all subsystems (dependency management, packaging, validation, remediation) into coordinated workflows. This guide explains how to use the new orchestration features for seamless integration between local and remote environments.

## Architecture

### Orchestration Coordinator

The `OrchestrationCoordinator` (in `scripts/orchestration_coordinator.py`) provides a unified interface for:

- **Dependency Management**: Preflight, guard, upgrade, sync
- **Packaging**: Wheelhouse building, offline packaging
- **Validation**: Offline doctor, artifact verification
- **Remediation**: Failure analysis and recommendations
- **Synchronization**: Local ↔ Remote artifact sync
- **State Management**: Persistent orchestration state tracking

### CLI Integration

All orchestration features are accessible via the `prometheus orchestrate` command:

```bash
prometheus orchestrate status          # Show current state
prometheus orchestrate full-dependency # Complete dependency workflow
prometheus orchestrate full-packaging  # Complete packaging workflow
prometheus orchestrate sync-remote     # Sync remote artifacts
```

## Workflows

### 1. Full Dependency Workflow

Executes the complete dependency management pipeline:

```bash
prometheus orchestrate full-dependency \
  --auto-upgrade \
  --force-sync \
  --verbose
```

**Steps**:

1. **Preflight**: Checks dependency health, version conflicts, security advisories
2. **Guard**: Analyzes upgrade risks, detects breaking changes
3. **Upgrade** (optional): Generates weighted upgrade plan
4. **Sync**: Synchronizes dependency contracts and manifests

**Outputs**:

- `var/dependency-preflight/latest.json` - Preflight results
- `var/upgrade-guard/assessment.json` - Risk assessment
- `var/upgrade-guard/summary.md` - Human-readable summary
- `var/orchestration-state.json` - Persistent state

**Use Cases**:

- Before planning dependency updates
- After modifying `configs/dependency-profile.toml`
- Weekly maintenance routine
- Pre-release validation

### 2. Full Packaging Workflow

Executes the complete packaging pipeline:

```bash
prometheus orchestrate full-packaging \
  --validate \
  --verbose
```

**Steps**:

1. **Wheelhouse Build**: Creates offline installation package with all dependencies
2. **Offline Package**: Generates complete air-gapped bundle (models, containers, checksums)
3. **Validation**: Runs offline doctor to verify package integrity
4. **Remediation** (if needed): Analyzes failures and generates recommendations

**Outputs**:

- `vendor/wheelhouse/` - Offline installation wheels
- `vendor/offline/` - Complete air-gapped bundle
- `var/offline-doctor-results.json` - Validation results
- `var/remediation-recommendations.json` - Fix suggestions

**Use Cases**:

- Before air-gapped deployment
- After dependency updates
- Weekly artifact refresh
- Release preparation

### 3. Remote-to-Local Sync

Syncs artifacts from remote builds to local environment:

```bash
# Download artifact from GitHub Actions first
gh run download <run-id> -n offline-packaging-suite-optimized

# Sync to local environment
prometheus orchestrate sync-remote \
  ./offline-packaging-suite-optimized \
  --validate \
  --verbose
```

**Steps**:

1. **Copy**: Extracts artifacts to local `vendor/` directory
2. **Sync**: Updates dependency contracts and Poetry lock
3. **Validate**: Verifies package completeness and integrity

**Outputs**:

- Updated `vendor/wheelhouse/`
- Synchronized `poetry.lock`
- Updated `constraints/production.txt`
- Validation report

**Use Cases**:

- Syncing multi-platform wheels from CI
- Updating local environment from remote builds
- Testing remote artifacts locally
- Pre-deployment verification

### 4. Orchestration Status

Check current orchestration state and get recommendations:

```bash
prometheus orchestrate status --verbose
```

**Shows**:

- Dependencies synced status
- Wheelhouse built status
- Validation passed status
- Last operation metadata
- Actionable recommendations

**Use Cases**:

- Understanding current system state
- Troubleshooting workflow issues
- Planning next steps
- CI status checks

## Integration Patterns

### Pattern 1: CI → Local Development

Remote CI builds wheels, developer syncs locally:

```bash
# On CI (GitHub Actions)
# - offline-packaging workflow builds multi-platform wheels via cibuildwheel
# - Generates preflight, guard, and remediation artifacts
# - Uploads as offline-packaging-suite-optimized artifact

# Local developer workflow
gh run download <run-id> -n offline-packaging-suite-optimized
prometheus orchestrate sync-remote ./offline-packaging-suite-optimized
prometheus orchestrate status
```

### Pattern 2: Weekly Maintenance

Automated weekly dependency and packaging refresh:

```bash
# Monday morning maintenance
prometheus orchestrate full-dependency --auto-upgrade
prometheus orchestrate full-packaging --validate

# Review recommendations
prometheus orchestrate status --verbose
cat var/upgrade-guard/summary.md
cat var/remediation-recommendations.json | jq .
```

### Pattern 3: Pre-Release Checklist

Complete validation before release:

```bash
# 1. Dependency health check
prometheus orchestrate full-dependency --force-sync

# 2. Build fresh packages
prometheus orchestrate full-packaging --validate

# 3. Verify status
prometheus orchestrate status

# 4. Review any issues
if [ -f var/remediation-recommendations.json ]; then
  echo "⚠️ Remediation needed:"
  cat var/remediation-recommendations.json | jq -r '.recommendations[] | "  - " + .'
fi
```

### Pattern 4: Air-Gapped Deployment

Complete offline bundle preparation:

```bash
# 1. Build locally or download from CI
prometheus orchestrate full-packaging

# 2. Validate bundle
prometheus offline-doctor --package-dir vendor/offline --format table

# 3. Create deployment archive
cd vendor/offline
tar -czf ../../prometheus-airgapped-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz .
cd ../..
sha256sum prometheus-airgapped-*.tar.gz > prometheus-airgapped-*.tar.gz.sha256

# 4. Transfer to air-gapped environment and deploy
# (See docs/cibuildwheel-integration.md for deployment instructions)
```

## Programmatic API

The orchestration coordinator can be used programmatically:

```python
from scripts.orchestration_coordinator import (
    OrchestrationCoordinator,
    OrchestrationContext,
)

# Create coordinator
context = OrchestrationContext(mode="hybrid", verbose=True)
coordinator = OrchestrationCoordinator(context)

# Run individual operations
preflight_results = coordinator.deps_preflight()
guard_results = coordinator.deps_guard()
coordinator.deps_sync(force=True)

# Run complete workflows
dependency_results = coordinator.full_dependency_workflow(
    auto_upgrade=True,
    force_sync=True,
)

packaging_results = coordinator.full_packaging_workflow(
    validate=True,
)

# Check status
status = coordinator.get_status()
for recommendation in status["recommendations"]:
    print(f"→ {recommendation}")
```

## State Management

The orchestration coordinator maintains persistent state in `var/orchestration-state.json`:

```json
{
  "mode": "hybrid",
  "dry_run": false,
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "dependencies_synced": true,
  "wheelhouse_built": true,
  "validation_passed": true,
  "metadata": {
    "preflight": { ... },
    "guard": { ... },
    "upgrade_plan": { ... },
    "validation": { ... },
    "remediation": { ... }
  }
}
```

This enables:

- Resuming interrupted workflows
- Tracking operation history
- Generating intelligent recommendations
- Cross-workflow coordination

## Telemetry and Observability

All orchestration operations are instrumented with OpenTelemetry:

- **Traces**: Full workflow spans with nested operations
- **Metrics**: Operation durations, success/failure counts
- **Logs**: Structured logging with context

View traces in Jaeger/Tempo:

```bash
# Operations appear as:
# - orchestrate.full_dependency
# - orchestrate.full_packaging
# - orchestrate.sync_remote
# - orchestrate.deps_preflight
# - orchestrate.deps_guard
# etc.
```

## Error Handling and Remediation

The orchestration coordinator integrates remediation at every step:

1. **Automatic Detection**: Failures trigger remediation analysis
2. **Recommendations**: Actionable fix suggestions generated
3. **State Preservation**: Failed operations don't block retries
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Partial success when possible

Example remediation flow:

```bash
# Workflow fails during packaging
prometheus orchestrate full-packaging

# Check what went wrong
prometheus orchestrate status
# Shows: validation_passed: false

# Review remediation recommendations
cat var/remediation-recommendations.json
# Suggests: Pin package X to version Y, or add to ALLOW_SDIST_FOR

# Apply fix and retry
# ... make changes ...
prometheus orchestrate full-packaging
```

## Advanced Features

### Dry Run Mode

Test workflows without side effects:

```bash
prometheus orchestrate full-dependency --dry-run
prometheus orchestrate full-packaging --dry-run
```

### Verbose Output

Detailed logging for troubleshooting:

```bash
prometheus orchestrate full-dependency --verbose
# Shows:
# - Command execution details
# - Intermediate results
# - Timing information
# - State transitions
```

### Selective Operations

Run individual operations via the coordinator:

```python
from scripts.orchestration_coordinator import OrchestrationCoordinator, OrchestrationContext

coordinator = OrchestrationCoordinator()

# Just preflight
coordinator.deps_preflight()

# Just guard
coordinator.deps_guard()

# Just sync
coordinator.deps_sync(force=True)

# Just wheelhouse
coordinator.build_wheelhouse()

# etc.
```

## Integration with Existing Tools

The orchestration coordinator integrates seamlessly with existing tools:

### Poetry

```bash
# Coordinator respects Poetry configuration
poetry install
prometheus orchestrate full-dependency
```

### GitHub CLI

```bash
# Download artifacts, then orchestrate
gh run download <run-id> -n offline-packaging-suite-optimized
prometheus orchestrate sync-remote ./offline-packaging-suite-optimized
```

### Docker

```bash
# Orchestrate can prepare container exports
prometheus orchestrate full-packaging
# Includes container exports in vendor/offline/images/
```

### Temporal

```bash
# Orchestrate can manage Temporal schedules
prometheus deps snapshot ensure  # Creates/updates schedules
prometheus orchestrate full-dependency  # Uses scheduled snapshots
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Orchestration state corrupted

**Symptom**: Commands fail with state errors

**Solution**:

```bash
# Reset orchestration state
rm var/orchestration-state.json
prometheus orchestrate status
# Rebuilds fresh state
```

### Issue: Sync fails with conflicts

**Symptom**: `orchestrate sync-remote` reports conflicts

**Solution**:

```bash
# Force sync to override local changes
prometheus deps sync --apply --force

# Or manually resolve conflicts in poetry.lock
# Then retry sync
prometheus orchestrate sync-remote <artifact-dir> --no-validate
```

### Issue: Packaging validation fails

**Symptom**: `full-packaging` completes but validation fails

**Solution**:

```bash
# Check detailed validation results
prometheus offline-doctor --format json > /tmp/validation.json
cat /tmp/validation.json | jq .

# Check remediation recommendations
cat var/remediation-recommendations.json | jq -r '.recommendations[]'

# Apply fixes and retry
```

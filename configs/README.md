# Configs

This directory holds configuration templates and documentation for every
deployment profile described in the `Promethus Brief.md`.

## Configuration layers

1. **Defaults (`configs/defaults/`).** Baseline settings shared across laptop,
   self-hosted, and SaaS deployments. `pipeline.toml` captures the bootstrap
   pipeline wiring used by the CLI entrypoint (filesystem/web connectors,
   RapidFuzz + Qdrant hybrid retrieval, Temporal execution, Prometheus +
   OpenTelemetry collectors).
2. **Environment overrides (`configs/env/`).** Per-environment values (dev,
   staging, prod) that tune feature flags, SLO thresholds, and telemetry sinks.
3. **Secrets (`.env`, secret managers).** API keys, credentials, and signing
   material; never commit secrets to the repo. Reference them through
   environment variables documented in `.env.example`.
4. **Plugin manifests.** Optional extensions declare required configuration and
   permissions; keep manifests colocated with each plugin and document any new
   keys here.

## Packaging profiles

- **Laptop / desktop:** Use `.env.local` to specify lightweight model paths,
  local storage directories, and disable heavy telemetry exporters.
- **Self-hosted server:** Configure queue backends, distributed cache
  addresses, certificate locations, and logging destinations. Enforce
  per-tenant encryption keys and RBAC scopes via environment variables.
- **SaaS multi-tenant:** Store secrets in the cloud providerâ€™s key vault,
  enable feature flag backends, and set rollout/canary percentages.
  Provide automation for rotation of signing keys and SBOM artefacts.
- **CLI / SDK:** Expose minimal configuration (API base URL, auth token)
  so scripting clients can interact with staging or production clusters.

## Operational guidance

- Keep configuration files under source control except for secrets.
- Document any new setting in this README, including acceptable ranges and
  its impact on quality gates or SLOs.
- Provide migration notes when renaming or removing settings; update
  `docs/developer-experience.md` and relevant stage READMEs accordingly.
- Add validation hooks (TBD) that lint configuration values during CI and
  pre-flight checks before deployment.

### Ingestion connectors

- `[[ingestion.sources]]` supports `type = "filesystem" | "web" | "memory"`.
  Filesystem connectors accept `root`, optional `patterns` glob list, and
  `encoding`. Web connectors accept `urls`, optional `timeout`, and `user_agent`.
  Memory connectors accept `uri` and optional `content` for bootstrap data.
- `[ingestion.persistence]` selects either an in-memory store (`type = "memory"`)
  or SQLite (`type = "sqlite"`, `path = "var/ingestion.db"`).

### Retrieval backends

- `[retrieval.lexical]` defaults to the RapidFuzz backend; override when wiring
  external search engines.
- `[retrieval.vector]` enables the Qdrant backend with `backend = "qdrant"`,
  `collection`, `location`, and optional `vector_size` overrides.
- `[retrieval.reranker]` currently supports `strategy = "keyword_overlap"` and
  `min_overlap` thresholds while cross-encoder support is staged.

### Execution and monitoring adapters

- `[execution]` now supports `sync_target = "temporal" | "webhook" | "in-memory"`
  with adapter-specific options under `[execution.adapter]`.
- `[[monitoring.collectors]]` accepts `type = "prometheus"` (Pushgateway) or
  `type = "opentelemetry"` (console/OTLP exporters) with respective fields for
  gateway URLs and exporter endpoints.

## Backlog

- Add `.env.example` templates covering pipeline stages, model gateway, and
  telemetry sinks.
- Document integration-specific configuration (e.g., Jira, Slack, email).
- Script configuration diff tooling to highlight unsafe changes before rollout.

# Promethus Brief

## Executive Summary

Organisations today need a **"strategy OS"** - an intelligent system that can
turn messy, heterogeneous inputs (documents, data, domain knowledge) into
**defensible, evidence-linked strategy and execution plans**. The mandate is to
design this system **OSS-first** (open source by default, with optional paid
plug-ins) and **frontier-grade** across all key dimensions:
_accuracy/truthfulness, latency/throughput, robustness & safety, observability,
security/compliance, maintainability, and UX/DX_. In other words, it must rival
or exceed the state of the art (including proprietary systems) on every front.
The value proposition is substantial: any organisation - from a startup on a
laptop to an enterprise on a cluster - could make high-stakes decisions grounded
in data and rigorous reasoning, with full explainability and auditability. For
example, **ISO 9001:2015** quality management highlights _evidence-based
decision-making_ as a core principle, since "without relying on facts, decisions
can only be correct by sheer luck," whereas decisions based on analyzed data
_"significantly increase the probability of achieving desired results."_ By
leveraging the latest in open-source AI/ML, knowledge management, and software
engineering, this Strategy OS will enable organizations to respond to complex
challenges with _speed_ (through automation and AI assistance),
_trustworthiness_ (through evidence-linked rationale and compliance controls),
and _adaptability_ (through modular, extensible design).

**What "good" looks like:** Success means the system produces **decisions and
plans that are explainable, auditable, and effective**. Every major decision
should come with a transparent rationale (linked to source evidence and explicit
assumptions), alternative options considered (with forecasted outcomes), and a
record in an immutable decision log. The quality of decisions should improve
over time - e.g. forecasting calibration error (Brier score) decreasing as the
system learns, and no significant "unknown unknowns" left unprobed. Users (both
non-technical and experts) should report **high satisfaction**, with faster
time-to-insight and confidence that the recommendations are reliable.
Critically, the system must enforce **rigorous quality gates**: for instance,
**no strategic recommendation is finalized unless it's grounded in the knowledge
base (with citations)**, and **no execution plan passes review unless risk
checks, compliance (GDPR/POPIA), and quality metrics are green-lit**. In sum,
the Strategy OS will serve as a _"second brain"_ for organizations - ingesting
and filtering information, reasoning over it like a team of analysts, and
outputting well-structured strategies with the _evidence, reasoning, and
contingencies_ clearly laid out. This document presents a comprehensive plan
covering the capability stack, architecture, model strategy, performance, UX,
DX, and more - all designed to meet that north star of an **open, intelligent,
and frontier-grade strategy co-pilot for businesses**.

Each module exposes an **open interface**, allowing teams to swap underlying
implementations without breaking upstream or downstream contracts. Retrieval
could pair ElasticSearch with FAISS or call a hosted embedding API as long as
the query contract stays intact. This modular emphasis keeps the system
future-proof: new risk models, collaboration tools, or inference backends can
slot in without rewriting the core.

## Architecture Overview (Data & Control Flow)

The architecture follows a **modular, layered design** with clear separation of
concerns and plugin isolation. Below is a high-level data flow:

        B[Data Ingestion & Provenance<br/>(raw inputs parsed, normalized)]

        D -- draft decisions/strategy + evidence --> E
        C -- retrieval query --> D
        D -- retrieved context --> C
```

**Figure: System Data/Control Flow.** _Note:_ Horizontal arrows indicate data
flow; feedback loops (e.g. monitoring outcomes feeding back into reasoning for
continuous learning) are shown at the bottom.

- **Ingestion → Knowledge:** Users provide inputs (or connectors fetch external
  data on schedule). The **Ingestion module** parses and normalizes this into
  the **Knowledge Store**, which could be implemented via a document database
  plus vector index. This separation ensures raw data is preserved with
  provenance, while indexes are built for speedy retrieval. Ingestion is also a
  point where content is classified (e.g. tag documents with topics or access
  level) to enable context-aware retrieval and enforce permissions.
- **Retrieval ↔ Reasoning:** When the Reasoning engine needs information, it
  queries the Knowledge Store via the **Retrieval module**. We use a _hybrid
  retrieve-then-read_ architecture common in RAG (Retrieval-Augmented
  Generation): the query goes to both a keyword index and a vector index,
  possibly uses a **reranker** model, then returns a set of relevant passages
  with citations. The Reasoning engine (an orchestration of LLMs and logic)
  consumes those and may iterate (ask follow-up queries) - hence a loop where
  the Reasoning engine can feed back into retrieval if needed (the
  bi-directional arrow).
- **Reasoning → Decision:** The Reasoning engine produces recommendations or
  analyses. These are handed to the **Decision Core**. The Decision Core applies
  business rules and context. For example, if the Reasoning suggests "Shut down
  Project X", the Decision module will notice this is a high-impact (perhaps
  irreversible) decision and trigger additional controls (maybe route to a
  human-in-the-loop or require more evidence). If it's a routine reversible
  decision ("Allocate an extra server for load"), it might auto-approve. The
  Decision Core writes an entry to the **Decision Ledger** either way, including
  status (proposed/approved/denied) and a unique ID for traceability.
- **Decision → Planning:** Approved decisions (especially ones that turn into
  initiatives or tasks) flow to the **Execution module**. Here, the system
  generates or updates the program/initiative/tactic graph. For instance, if the
  strategy is approved to "expand to Market Y", the Execution module might
  create a Program "Market Y Expansion" with associated initiatives (market
  research, hiring, marketing campaign, etc.). This module interfaces with
  external PM tools (through plugins) so that these items can be pushed to where
  work is tracked. Importantly, this is **idempotent**: running the sync twice
  won't duplicate tasks thanks to stable IDs. This module also sets up
  monitoring hooks for each deliverable (tying back to metrics and risks).
- **Monitoring/Feedback:** As execution proceeds, data on progress and outcomes
  is collected by the **Measurement & Risk modules**. This flows into an
  **Adaptation loop**: the system can periodically re-run the Reasoning engine
  with updated data (e.g. quarterly re-forecast, or scenario adjustments) and
  flag if the strategy needs to change. Because decisions are logged and linked
  to outcomes, the system can learn - e.g. "Decision A (launching product early)
  turned out negative, noted for future planning."

**Plugin Architecture & Isolation:** Each module is a potential extension point:

- Modules communicate via **well-defined APIs** (could be gRPC/REST or
  in-process interfaces). For example, the Retrieval module offers a
  search(query, filters) -> results API. This makes it possible to plug in
  different backends.
- **Plugin Discovery:** The system will define an interface spec for each plugin
  type (e.g. an ingestion adapter, a model provider, an output exporter). A
  plugin registry (maybe just a config file or a plugins folder) will allow new
  plugins to be discovered at startup. For security, each plugin will declare
  required permissions (e.g. "needs internet access" or "can run local code")
  and the core can sandbox or restrict as appropriate.
- **Isolation & Fault Tolerance:** Plugins run in separate processes or
  sandboxes when possible. E.g., if using a proprietary model API plugin, that
  plugin can fail without crashing the whole system - the Model Gateway
  (discussed later) would isolate timeouts/exceptions. We'll implement fallback
  strategies: if a plugin fails, have a default or degraded mode (maybe the OSS
  fallback).
- **Low-End vs High-End Path:** The architecture supports running everything on
  a single machine (even CPU-only) by selecting lightweight implementations for
  each module (e.g. use a small local vector index and a small local model). On
  high-end clusters, each module can scale out (e.g. a distributed ingestion
  pipeline, a vector database cluster, etc.). An **Auto-Configurator** component
  will detect the environment at install/runtime (CPU cores, GPU presence, RAM)
  and adjust module implementations. For instance, on a laptop with no GPU, it
  might choose a 7B parameter distilled model for Reasoning; on a server with
  A100 GPUs, it might load a 70B model with full precision. The design thus
  **scales down and up** seamlessly.

**Data flow example:** To make this concrete, imagine a user asks: _"Given our
Q3 performance, what should be our marketing strategy for product X for next
year?"_

- The query goes to **Reasoning**, which breaks it down: it needs Q3 performance
  data and past marketing tactics.
- **Retrieval** fetches Q3 reports and relevant documents (sales data, previous
  strategy docs) from **Knowledge Store**.
- Reasoning (perhaps using an LLM) reads those and formulates a draft strategy.
- **Decision Core** sees this involves budget allocations (maybe an irreversible
  decision), so it attaches a note that CFO approval is needed.
- The strategy plan goes to **Execution** which creates a roadmap of campaigns
  (deliverables) and syncs to, say, Jira.
- As campaigns run, **Monitoring** captures metrics (lead volume, conversion
  rate) and the **Risk module** flags any early warnings (maybe ads are
  overspending without ROI).
- The **Adaptation** triggers Reasoning to re-evaluate mid-year and possibly
  suggest course corrections, which go through Decision again.

Throughout, every recommendation the LLM made was grounded in retrieved
documents (with citations included), ensuring **auditability and trust** - a
stakeholder can click a recommendation and see, _"Ah, this was based on
Q3_Report.pdf, line 45"_.

In summary, the architecture is **event-driven and modular** - each component
does one part of the process and passes it on, with extensive logging and the
ability to fork into manual/human-in-loop steps when needed. By designing this
way, we achieve both **flexibility (easy to swap components or change scale)**
and **robustness (issues in one module don't corrupt others, and everything is
observable)**.

## Provider & Model Strategy (OSS-first, Cloud-Smart)

One of the most critical components is the **Model Provider Strategy** -
selecting and orchestrating the AI models that will power tasks like text
generation, Q&A, classification, embedding, etc. The goal is to be
**provider-agnostic and cost-efficient** while leveraging open models as much as
possible (for data control and cost reasons). Key points of the strategy:

**Unified Model Gateway:** We will implement a **model gateway service** that
acts as an abstraction layer for all AI model calls. Instead of the core code
calling, say, OpenAI API directly or a local model directly, it calls the
gateway with a request like "need embedding for text X" or "need completion for
prompt Y with max length Z". The gateway holds the logic for:

- _Routing:_ It decides which model (or provider API) to use for this request
  based on policies and real-time performance. For example, it might route small
  tasks to a local model (to save cost and latency) but big ones to a remote API
  if the local model isn't powerful enough.
- _Model ensemble or cascade:_ The gateway can also orchestrate multiple models
  if needed (e.g. use a cheap model to generate candidate answers and a
  expensive model to verify or refine them).
- _Monitoring and fallback:_ If a model fails (API error or doesn't meet a
  quality criteria), the gateway can retry with an alternative. It also records
  performance metrics for each model invocation.

**Open-Source First:** We prioritize using **open-weight models** running
locally (or on the user's infrastructure) to avoid external dependencies, but
**with pragmatism**: if the user has opted into a paid service and it
demonstrably gives significantly better results or faster responses, the gateway
can leverage it. Some tactics:

- Include a library of state-of-the-art open models for various tasks: e.g.
  **Llama 2** (or its successors) for general reasoning, smaller distilled
  models for fast queries, **BioGPT or FinBERT** if domain-specific, etc. We
  will continuously evaluate these models. Notably, open models have recently
  reached "frontier-grade" capability; for instance, a 120B open model has shown
  performance matching proprietary models on complex tasks. This means our
  OSS-first approach does not significantly sacrifice quality, especially if we
  leverage fine-tuning.
- Provide hooks to **optional providers**: e.g. OpenAI, Anthropic, Google PaLM,
  etc., via plugins. The user can configure an API key and the gateway will then
  consider those models in its routing logic. But _they are not required_ - the
  system with no API keys still functions fully, using local models.

**Task-Specific Model Selection:** Different tasks demand different model types:

- For **natural language generation** (the strategy write-ups, explanations):
  we'll use a large language model (LLM). The gateway might choose a smaller
  7-13B model for simple queries (to give fast responses) but switch to a 30B+
  model for a complex multi-step reasoning. It could even use a summarization
  model for condensing content, vs a dialogue model for interactive Q&A.
- For **information extraction or classification** (like labeling data during
  ingestion, or extracting entities): smaller fine-tuned transformers (or even
  classical ML) might suffice and be much faster.
- For **embedding and similarity** (vector search): use a dedicated embedding
  model. Possibly allow user to choose (there are many OSS embedding models like
  InstructorXL, etc., or API ones like OpenAI Ada).
- For **reranking** retrieval results: a cross-encoder model that is good at
  reading a query+passage and giving a relevance score (e.g. MiniLM or
  co-condenser).
- For **speech or vision** (if those inputs are in scope, e.g. maybe ingest
  audio transcripts or diagrams): plugins for OCR or ASR (Automatic Speech
  Recognition) could be integrated (open ones like Whisper for ASR, Tesseract or
  PaddleOCR for OCR, etc.).

All these are accessible through the model gateway, which hides the complexity.

**Automatic Model Selection Logic:** We will implement a scoring function that
considers **three key dimensions** for model selection: **quality, speed
(latency), and cost**. Essentially:

- Each potential model (local or API) is tagged with an estimated capability
  score for the task (based on evals) and an estimated cost (both monetary and
  computational) and latency.
- The gateway at runtime can make decisions like: _"User is on a CPU laptop, so
  Model A (distilled) gives adequate accuracy with 1s latency vs Model B (large)
  would be 10s - choose A for now."_ Or _"This is a critical analysis where
  accuracy is paramount, use the best model available even if slower."_
- We will allow configuration of **preferences** (e.g. an organisation might say
  "prefer cheaper even if slightly less accurate" or vice versa, or a user might
  press a "High Precision" button for particularly crucial questions).
- The system can also dynamically adjust: for instance, if the local GPU is busy
  or low on memory, route more queries to an external service temporarily.

**Continuous Benchmarking:** To drive model selection, we need data:

- We'll maintain a **suite of benchmarks** relevant to our use cases (a mix of
  standard NLP tasks and custom evaluations). For instance, factual QA
  benchmarks to test groundedness, a reasoning benchmark, maybe a forecasting
  accuracy test, etc. OSS resources like HELM or OpenAI's evals can be
  leveraged, and we'll add domain-specific tests (e.g. if the system is often
  used for finance strategy, include some financial QA in the eval).
- Whenever we update the system or a new model is plugged in, run the evals. The
  results feed the model scoring in the gateway. We'll also encourage an
  approach of _"trust but verify"_ for hype - e.g. not assume a new model is
  better until proven on our criteria.
- The gateway can even do **dynamic testing**: occasionally A/B test two models
  on a live query (with user permission) to see if one yields better user
  feedback or results. Over time, it "learns" which models are most reliable for
  which tasks.

**Safety and Policy Enforcement:** All generative steps will have safety checks.
We will integrate a **content filter** component (could be an open-source
classifier or a rule-based system initially) to examine outputs for disallowed
content (hate, self-harm advice, etc., following defined usage policies). For
open models, we can apply a **"Constitutional AI"** approach: incorporate a
system prompt with guidelines and have the model critique its outputs for
safety. For API models that have their own filters (OpenAI has some, etc.),
still double-check on our side (belt-and-suspenders approach). If a generative
output fails a safety check, the system will either refuse, redact, or ask the
reasoning module to adjust (e.g. rephrase answer). All such events are logged in
the observability module for review.

Additionally, **perturbation testing** will be done on the models: we'll
regularly test prompts that simulate adversarial or sensitive scenarios to
ensure compliance. If needed, we maintain a _safe completion template_ - e.g.
always cite sources (reducing hallucinations) and include a disclaimer if
confidence is low or policy might be violated.

**Provider "Cloud-Smart" Integration:** If using external APIs, design for
**fault tolerance and data privacy**:

- Use them statelessly (don't rely on them to store any data, we only send
  necessary prompts).
- Any sensitive data in prompts either avoid sending externally or use
  encryption/homomorphic methods if possible (this is tricky; likely easier is
  to opt-out and use local models for highly sensitive data).
- Rate limiting and cost tracking in the gateway to avoid bill shocks.
- If an external provider goes down, system falls back to local (with perhaps a
  degraded answer rather than failing entirely).

**Example scenario:** For quick chat responses during collaboration, the system
might use a fast local model (so user sees near-instant draft) and
simultaneously send to a larger model in the cloud; if the cloud returns a much
better answer, it can be presented or used to refine the local one's output
(this is an example of _"fallback/cascade"_). The user might not even notice
except the answer gets edited a second later with improvements.

In conclusion, this strategy gives us **flexibility** to use the _best tool for
the job on the fly_, while defaulting to open solutions that we control. It also
provides a path to continuously improve as new models (OSS or API) come out - we
plug them in, evaluate, and the gateway will route to them when appropriate. By
measuring real-world usage (where do models struggle? how often do we need the
expensive option?), we can also guide future fine-tuning efforts (perhaps
fine-tune an open model on our domain data to reduce dependency on a closed
model).

## Evaluation & Quality Gates

To ensure the system is truly "frontier-grade," we establish **concrete quality
gates and success criteria** for each capability. These gates act as
**checkpoints** in development and deployment - the system must meet or exceed
certain metrics before being considered ready. They also guide _continuous
evaluation_ post-release (with CI/CD pipelines running tests, and monitoring in
production).

Below is a matrix of key quality criteria, metrics, and target thresholds:

- **Retrieval Relevance:** _Metric:_ top-k retrieval performance on standard
  benchmarks (e.g. Recall@5 on a known Q&A dataset, NDCG on document search).
  _Gate:_ The hybrid retrieval should outperform a baseline keyword search by
  > 20% on Recall@5. Also, **Citation Accuracy** must be high - when the
  > reasoning engine uses a source, it should cite it correctly. _Metric:_ a
  > manual eval of generated reports where facts are checked against cited
  > sources; target ≥ 95% of factual statements are supported by the cited source
  > (no hallucinated citations). This will be tested with internal Q&A sets and by
  > spot-checking outputs (anything unsupported is a fail to fix).
- **Reasoning Groundedness & Truthfulness:** For RAG outputs (LLM answers with
  sources), measure **Groundedness Score** - how much the answer content is
  supported by provided docs. _Gate:_ groundedness above, say, 0.7 on a 0-1
  scale for 90% of evaluated answers (with no critical hallucinations). Also use
  tasks like TruthfulQA to ensure model doesn't produce known falsehoods -
  require performance above a threshold (e.g. match top 10% of models on
  TruthfulQA). Internally, define that any _final plan_ content must have either
  an evidence cite or an explicit marking as assumption/opinion. If the system
  produces uncited claims, that's flagged in QA.
- **Decision Explainability & Auditability:** _Criteria:_ Every major decision
  (Type 1 and key Type 2) should have: a recorded rationale, at least one
  alternative considered, and links to context. _Gate:_ In a random sample of
  decisions in the log, ≥ 95% have full context (problem statement, evidence
  references) and ≥ 95% have at least one alternative logged. Also, decisions
  should carry a "next review date" or trigger if applicable (especially
  reversible ones) - ensure e.g. 100% of Type 2 decisions in the last quarter
  have an automated follow-up or review (to avoid neglecting to reverse if
  needed). We can implement CI tests that simulate decision creation via API and
  ensure the ledger entry format is correct and complete.
- **Evidence Linkage & Causal Honesty:** For strategies with causal models, we
  will check if the links are sensible. Possibly involve domain experts to
  review the _theory of change_ graph: _Gate:_ 100% of causal links in critical
  strategies are backed by either cited research or explicit assumptions. Use an
  _evidence coverage metric_: e.g. every outcome node should have ≥1 incoming
  evidence/assumption link. If any are orphan, flag it. This is more qualitative
  but can be enforced by requiring an "assumption justification" text for any
  link added without evidence.
- **Forecasting Accuracy & Calibration:** We will track _forecast Brier scores_
  for recurring forecasts. _Gate:_ The team's Brier score (or the system's, if
  automated) should show improvement quarter over quarter (or at least not
  degrade). Concretely, require that after 3 months of use, the Brier score of
  forecasts is better than a baseline (e.g. if just predicting overall
  averages). Also track _calibration_: e.g. if we say 70% probability, it should
  happen ~70% of time. _Gate:_ calibration error (difference between predicted
  freq and actual freq) below say 0.1 for main probability bins. These are
  long-term criteria; in development we'll simulate with historical data.
- **Balanced Metrics (avoiding Goodhart):** We will run scenario tests to see if
  optimizing one metric harms others. For example, if we optimize a leading
  metric aggressively in a simulation, does a lagging metric fall off? _Gate:_
  Design a set of "metric balance" tests where a strategy with multiple
  objectives is evaluated - ensure no single metric improves at the cost of
  catastrophic drop in another beyond a tolerance. Also enforce via code reviews
  that for every KPI there's a paired counter-metric or qualitative check (this
  is more of a design guideline than numeric gate).
- **Risk Management:** _Criteria:_ Risk tolerance adherence and incident
  response. _Gate:_ The system should detect and flag >90% of simulated risk
  violations in tests (e.g. inject a scenario where a metric goes beyond
  tolerance; the risk module should create an alert within X minutes). Also
  require that for each high-priority risk in the register, an **owner and
  mitigation** are recorded (no empty risk entries). Possibly use compliance
  tests: e.g. feed in a scenario and check the system's risk output matches
  expected mitigation steps.
- **User Satisfaction & UX:** This will be measured via user studies once the
  tool is in use. But some proxy gates: _Time-to-first-insight_ - from dropping
  a batch of documents in, how long until a useful summary or suggestion is
  produced. We target, say, <30 seconds for an average document dump to initial
  analysis (p95 under 60s). We'll test with various sizes and ensure that UX
  doesn't block (maybe stream results progressively). Also _task completion
  rate_ - define core user tasks (e.g. "ingest and get a strategic
  recommendation") and have new users try them; target >90% can do it without
  support by following our UI (this indicates UI clarity). Accessibility tests:
  run automated checkers (like axe) to ensure no WCAG AA violations; _Gate:_
  zero critical accessibility issues (like missing alt text, etc.) before
  release.
- **Robustness & Safety:** We will red-team the system with adversarial inputs
  (e.g. extremely large documents, or prompts trying to get the model to reveal
  PII or break rules). _Gate:_ In internal tests, 0 occurrences of the model
  violating the defined safety policies (it's unrealistic to be perfect, but
  critical failures must be zero; minor style issues maybe low). Also ensure the
  system handles max stress: e.g. ingest 1000 documents at once without crashing
  (maybe degrade gracefully with backpressure). Another metric: **uptime** -
  target an SLO of e.g. 99.5% uptime for core functionalities (meaning in
  automated ping tests, the system responds correctly). This ties to performance
  but is a quality gate in deployment.
- **Security & Compliance:** _Gate:_ **0** high-severity security
  vulnerabilities open at time of release (we will run dependency scans and
  penetration tests). Also test data flows to ensure GDPR/POPIA compliance: e.g.
  simulate a user "Right to be Forgotten" request - the user's data should be
  scrubbed (check DB that it's gone) within the required timeframe. We can
  include a unit test for deletion flows. Another compliance gate: if we have a
  policy "no PII in logs", we'll run regex/scanners on logs to confirm none
  present during tests. We also maintain that all artifacts are signed (test the
  verification step in CI - build an installer and verify signature in an
  automated way). Essentially, if any security test fails, that's a release
  blocker.
- **Observability & Monitoring:** _Gate:_ The system must produce an end-to-end
  trace for at least 95% of transactions in test (meaning we see spans from
  ingestion to answer in our tracing system). If traces are missing segments,
  fix instrumentation. Also ensure logs have no sensitive info (test with dummy
  SSNs in input, confirm not printed). We have a concept of **exemplars**
  (sample traces for outliers) - _Gate:_ for any latency P99 breach, an exemplar
  trace is captured with cause annotated (we can simulate a slow component and
  see if the system flags it). In CI, we'll also include some **black-box
  tests**: feed known input, expect known output (regression tests for core
  logic).

These are some of the key quality gates. The plan is to automate as many as
possible in CI/CD (see Developer Experience section) so that every change is
evaluated against these criteria. Additionally, we'll have a **promotion
process**: features go from dev → staging → prod only if they meet the quality
bars on staging. For example, a new retrieval algorithm must show on staging
(with real or sample data) that it improved retrieval metrics without hurting
latency, _before_ it replaces the old one in production.

Finally, a **Quality dashboard** will be maintained for internal use,
summarizing these metrics over time (so we know if something starts regressing,
we catch it). "Frontier-grade" means not only hitting these targets once, but
continuously keeping them high, so continuous monitoring of these quality KPIs
is crucial.

## Performance, Scale & Cost Plan

We aim for a **high-performance system** that scales smoothly from a single
laptop to enterprise servers. This involves setting clear **Service Level
Objectives (SLOs)** for latency and throughput, optimizing resource use, and
designing for scalability (both in software architecture and deployment
topology).

### Target SLOs

- **Ingestion Latency:** E.g. **p95** ingestion time for a 100-page document <
  10 seconds on a typical laptop. (Meaning 95% of single-doc ingestions complete
  within 10s.) On a server with parallelism, much faster. _Why:_ Users shouldn't
  wait minutes just to add data.
- **Retrieval Query Latency:** p50 ~50ms, p95 <200ms for a query on a knowledge
  base of say 100k docs. This ensures snappy interactive response. We might note
  that web search SLOs are often 200ms for p95. We'll use techniques like
  pre-indexing, in-memory stores, etc.
- **Reasoning Latency:** This varies by model and task length. For short Q&A,
  aim <2 seconds p50, <5s p95 with a local model (on decent hardware). For big
  plan generation (which might be long), it could be 10-30s - but we will use
  streaming output so user sees partial results. We also allow asynchronous
  processing for very heavy tasks (with a notification when ready).
- **Overall end-to-end for a typical query (with data already ingested):** p50
  ~1-2s, p95 ~5s on a workstation. For more complex multi-step tasks, perhaps up
  to 15s but with progress indication. We will set an internal budget like:
  retrieval 0.2s, model think 2s, rest overhead negligible.

These SLOs will be refined with feedback. We'll include an _error budget_
approach - e.g. if we aim 99% under 3s, then 1% can be slower; if more than
that, we consider it a performance incident to address.

**Auto-Benchmarking & Configuration:** On first install/run, the system performs
a **hardware benchmark**. For example, run a tiny model inference to see if a
GPU is present and measure its speed, check CPU core count, RAM, disk. Based on
that, it auto-tunes:

- Chooses default model sizes (as discussed in Model Strategy).
- Chooses quantization if appropriate (e.g. on CPU, use 4-bit quantization of
  model to speed up at slight accuracy cost).
- Sets batch sizes or parallelism for ingestion (e.g. if 8 cores, can parse 8
  files in parallel).
- If memory is low, perhaps disable some heavy features or warn user.

These settings can be overridden by advanced users, but we provide a safe auto
mode with **guardrails**. For instance, if a user tries to load a huge model on
a small GPU, the system will warn or refuse (rather than crash swap). We'll
maintain a profile of "minimal hardware requirements" (like >=16GB RAM
recommended, etc., and detect if below, to adjust behavior or warn).

### Scalability - Low to High

- _Single-machine mode:_ All modules run in one process or a few processes. We
  ensure even here, the system is reactive (e.g. heavy background tasks yield to
  interactive ones to keep UI responsive).
- _Server mode:_ In an enterprise deployment, we can run modules as separate
  services (microservice style or as separate threads in one app). We can scale
  critical ones horizontally: e.g. multiple instances of retrieval serving
  different shards of the index (or using a distributed index), multiple
  instances of reasoning workers behind a queue if many simultaneous queries.
- _Auto-Scaling:_ We'll integrate with container orchestration (Kubernetes,
  etc.) for enterprise: provide helm charts with HPA (horizontal pod autoscaler)
  rules based on queue lengths or CPU usage. For local, maybe not needed, but
  for cloud SaaS we definitely need it - we'll use metrics like queries per
  second to scale out more reasoning workers, etc.
- We design statelessness where possible: e.g. the reasoning service should be
  stateless (just depends on knowledge store), so it's easy to scale
  horizontally.
- The Knowledge store can use a scalable backend like an Elasticsearch cluster
  or Postgres + pgvector. We'll document how to scale that (shard by data
  domain, etc.). Also support caching layers (to avoid hitting DB repeatedly for
  same query).
- _GPU scaling:_ If available GPUs are fewer than needed requests, we'll queue
  requests or run in mixed precision to speed up. Alternatively, on multi-GPU
  systems, we distribute different models to different GPUs (e.g. one GPU runs
  the big model for critical tasks, others run small ones for volume tasks).
- _Backpressure & Circuit Breakers:_ If some part gets overloaded (say retrieval
  DB too slow or model queue backed up), the system will propagate backpressure
  - e.g. the API might start returning "please wait" or UI shows a busy
    indicator. We'll implement **circuit breakers** for external calls: if an
    external model API is slow or failing, circuit-break it (stop sending more
    requests for a cool-off time) to avoid cascading latency. Likewise for any
    plugin that might hang.

**Zero-Downtime Updates:** For continuous delivery to production (for SaaS or
on-prem cluster updates), we plan:

- Use **canary releases**: deploy new version of a service to a small percentage
  of instances/users, monitor key metrics (latency, error rate, quality metrics
  if measurable). Only roll out to all if healthy. We can automate this with our
  feature flag system: e.g. feature flags enable new logic for 10% of requests
  initially.
- Use **blue-green deployments** or rolling updates for services so there's
  always an instance serving. Because state is mostly in databases (which can
  also do rolling upgrade), stateless services can be swapped one by one. We'll
  maintain backward compatibility in APIs so new and old can co-exist during
  rollout.
- _Migration downtime:_ For things like migrating the knowledge index or
  decision log schema, we'll design them to be done live if possible (e.g. dual
  writing to new schema, then switch reads). If not possible, at least ensure
  it's an automated and quick step.

### Performance Optimizations

- Use caching at multiple levels. E.g., results of expensive retrieval queries
  can be cached (with invalidation on data update). LLM responses for identical
  prompts + context can be cached short-term. Embeddings for documents
  definitely cached (compute once at ingestion).
- Optimize model runtime: use quantized models (4-bit, 8-bit) where slight
  accuracy loss is acceptable for huge speed gain. Use compiler optimizations
  (ONNX or TorchScript or Transformer Engine) for GPU efficiency. Possibly
  support model distillation in the field (fine-tune smaller model on the
  bigger's outputs for specific domains).
- Use asynchronous and batch processing: group multiple similar requests to the
  model into one batch to amortize overhead (the gateway can do this if requests
  pile up within a few milliseconds).
- Streaming and incremental computation: send partial results to UI as they are
  ready (user sees progress, also this can hide overall latency).
- We will set up a performance test harness that simulates heavy load (multiple
  users ingesting and querying) to ensure the system meets a certain throughput
  (e.g. can handle 50 concurrent queries on an 8-core machine with responses <2s
  p95, as a target).

**Cost Optimization:** Especially when running in cloud or using external APIs:

- Track usage of external API calls and provide cost estimates to user/admin.
  Possibly allow setting a monthly budget cap (then degrade to offline models if
  exceeded).
- Optimize cloud resource: for example, when idle, scale down model GPU usage
  (maybe unload large models if not used in last hour, to free memory or even
  shut down GPU instances in cloud environments to save cost).
- Use spot instances or scheduling if applicable (maybe heavy re-training tasks
  could be scheduled for nighttime when compute is cheaper).
- TCO (Total Cost of Ownership) focus: sometimes a faster model that is slightly
  bigger might actually be more cost-efficient if it handles more queries per
  second on the same hardware. We'll measure throughput and not just raw model
  size.

**Monitoring & Error budgets:** We integrate performance metrics into
observability. If SLOs are violated over a rolling window (e.g. latency SLO
95%<300ms falls to 90%), that consumes error budget. If budget gets low, that
triggers internal alarms to slow down releases or allocate more resources. This
SRE approach ensures we keep performance in check and prioritize it when
slipping.

By combining these strategies, we ensure that whether the Strategy OS is running
on a single modest server or distributed across a cluster, it remains
**responsive and efficient**. Users will benefit from quick answers, and
organizations will find it **cost-effective and scalable** as their usage grows.

## User Experience (UX) & Interface

Our diverse user base - from non-technical strategists to technical data
analysts - should find the Strategy OS **intuitive, helpful, and even
delightful** to use. We design the UX following principles of **clarity,
progressive disclosure, and user control**, while introducing intelligent
assistants to guide when needed. Here we outline key user journeys and how the
UI/UX supports them, along with accessibility and error handling considerations.

### Key User Journeys

#### Journey 1: "Dump of documents → Defensible brief."

- _Scenario:_ A user uploads a collection of documents (market research PDFs,
  financial reports, etc.) and wants the system to produce a strategy brief or
  analysis.
- **UX Flow:** The user lands on an **Ingestion Dashboard**. It allows
  drag-and-drop of files or connecting to data sources (with clear prompts:
  "Import your data here"). Once files are added, a progress indicator shows
  parsing. The UI immediately offers an **"Insight Preview"**: e.g., "3 key
  themes identified" as a quick output while full processing continues. This
  engages the user quickly.
- After ingestion, the user switches to an **Analysis Workspace**. Here, the
  left pane lists questions or prompts (the user can pick from suggestions like
  "Summarize market trends" or type their own query). The main pane shows the
  draft brief with inline citations (hyperlinked). We use **progressive
  disclosure**: initially, the brief is concise - just main points. Each point
  has a "detail" button to expand supporting arguments (so novice users aren't
  overwhelmed, but power users can dig deeper on demand). Citations appear as
  reference numbers - clicking opens a side panel showing the source excerpt.
- The brief is not just static text: the user can **ask follow-up questions** in
  a chat interface ("Why do we think market A is declining?") and the system
  will highlight part of the brief or append an explanation, citing evidence.
  This is the **interactive QA** overlay.
- At any time, the user can click "Show Reasoning" - an option that reveals the
  chain-of-thought or outline that the system used. This addresses
  explainability, letting them see assumptions or intermediate steps (maybe in a
  collapsible timeline or flowchart form).
- The outcome: the user receives a polished PDF/Word brief with all key points
  and an appendix of sources, ready to present - and they trust it, because
  everything is traceable.

#### Journey 2: "Hypothesis → Evidence & causal plan."

- _Scenario:_ A strategy team has a hypothesis: e.g. "Launching a loyalty
  program will improve customer retention by 20%." They want to validate
  evidence and create a plan around it.
- **UX Flow:** In the **Strategy Canvas** (a section of the UI), there's a
  template for forming hypotheses. The user enters the hypothesis statement. The
  system suggests "Identify supporting evidence" - clicking it triggers a search
  of the knowledge base (or even web if allowed) for similar cases or research.
  The UI might show an **Evidence Table**: each row is a piece of evidence
  (source title, one-line summary, relevance score) with a checkmark if the user
  decides to include it. The user can also add manual notes or upload a new
  piece of data.
- Next, the user switches to **Causal Model Builder** (maybe a visual diagram
  editor). The hypothesis node ("loyalty program → retention up") is shown, and
  the system (or user) adds connecting factors: e.g. "Increased engagement →
  retention" or "Costs of program" etc. For each link, the UI encourages adding
  justification. Perhaps an _AI assistant sidebar_ can suggest likely
  assumptions or point out if something's missing ("Have you considered the
  effect on new customer acquisition?").
- **Progressive guidance:** We don't force a user to draw complicated diagrams
  if they don't want. A non-technical user might instead fill a questionnaire
  ("What needs to happen for this to work?" etc.) and the system generates the
  underlying model behind the scenes. A more advanced user can toggle into the
  graph view to fine-tune.
- Once the theory-of-change is built, the user clicks "Generate Plan". The UI
  moves to a **Plan Editor** that lists proposed initiatives derived from each
  part of the causal chain (e.g. "Initiative: Launch loyalty program
  (deliverable: design campaign; metric: retention%)"). The user can adjust
  timeline via a Gantt chart view or Kanban board style for tasks. The plan is
  essentially one click away from being pushed to their project management tool.
- Throughout, **explainability** is present: if the system recommends an
  initiative, it's annotated with "because \[evidence\]" or "to influence
  \[outcome in model\]".
- The result: a strategic plan grounded in an explicit hypothesis and evidence,
  which stakeholders can review transparently.

#### Journey 3: "Options → Decision record with rationale."

- _Scenario:_ The user needs to make a specific decision (e.g. choose between
  Strategy A or B). They want to use the system to document it.
- **UX Flow:** They open a **Decision Wizard** (accessible from a "New Decision"
  button). Step 1 asks for context (they fill in title, description of the
  decision to be made). Step 2 either asks the user to list options or offers to
  generate options. Suppose the user requests generation: the system displays
  two or three **Option Cards**, each titled (Strategy A, B, C) with a brief
  description. The user can edit these or discard ones.
- Step 3: For each option, the UI has a **Criteria Matrix**. It lists factors
  (cost, time, upside, risk, etc.), either provided by user or suggested by AI.
  The user (or AI) can score each option on these criteria. We use a simple
  table UI or even an interactive radar chart.
- Step 4: The system generates a **Recommendation** highlight (e.g. "Option B is
  recommended given highest expected ROI and moderate risk"). This appears along
  with a textual rationale paragraph. The user can again edit or ask for
  clarification. Behind the scenes, the decision core ensures any irreversible
  flag or required approval is noted - the UI might show a badge "Type 1 -
  critical decision".
- Finally, the user clicks "Finalize Decision". The **Decision Ledger Entry** is
  created and shown for confirmation: it includes the decision summary, chosen
  option, key reasons, alternatives considered, date, owner. The UI allows
  exporting this as a PDF or emailing to stakeholders for transparency.
- Later, when that decision is up for review (maybe triggered by date or
  outcome), the UI will show a notification or bring the user back into a
  similar wizard to update or close the loop ("Outcome of decision: did we
  achieve X? Yes/No, learnings…").
- This journey ensures even a heavy process like decision documentation is done
  through _gentle guidance_ (wizard steps) rather than a blank form. It feels
  like the system is a facilitator.

#### Journey 4: "Plan → Project tool exports and tracking."

- _Scenario:_ The strategy is approved and now needs execution tracking.
- **UX Flow:** In the **Execution Dashboard**, the entire program/initiative
  hierarchy is visible (tree or collapsible list). High-level programs have
  status bubbles (e.g. on track, at risk - possibly colored by metrics coming
  in). A user can click "Sync to \[PM Tool\]" and after initial OAuth linking,
  tasks are pushed. The UI might show a diff view: "3 new tasks will be created,
  2 updated, 0 deleted" for transparency.
- After syncing, the dashboard starts showing live updates from the PM tool (via
  API integration) - e.g. task completion percentages, last update date. There's
  also a **Risk Heatmap** view: a matrix of initiatives vs risk level,
  highlighting any that are in trouble (say if metrics are red or deadlines
  slipped).
- The user can drill into one initiative, see its detail page: it includes
  objectives, linked metrics (with small sparkline charts), team members,
  comments. This acts as a one-stop page for that chunk of the plan.
- Collaboration is key here: team members can come into the strategy OS and
  comment on deliverables or upload progress reports. If offline, thanks to
  CRDT, as soon as they reconnect their comments sync without conflict.
- If a change is needed (scope adjustment), the user can edit the plan here and
  push updates to the PM tool, maintaining one source of truth.
- We ensure this execution view is _not_ siloed - it ties back to strategy.
  E.g., each initiative page might remind "This supports Goal X (increase
  retention 20%)." So context is always visible.

### Design Principles & Features

- **Progressive Disclosure:** As mentioned, we reveal complexity only as needed.
  The default views focus on key info. Advanced analyses, detailed options, or
  raw data are tucked behind "Show more" toggles or secondary screens. This
  keeps the UI clean. For example, a novice user might just see the high-level
  summary and trust it, whereas an analyst can expand to see the full evidence
  and model assumptions.
- **Assistive UI (Wizards & Templates):** We include wizard-like flows for
  complex tasks (as in the decision and planning scenarios). There will also be
  **templates** for common strategy documents (SWOT analysis, OKR definition,
  etc.) that the AI can help fill out interactively. This helps users not start
  from scratch.
- **Annotation & Explain:** Every piece of AI-generated content will have an
  "Explain" button or at least a tooltip: clicking it might say "This
  recommendation was made because \[brief reasoning\] and is based on
  \[sources\]." We may use a simpler language to explain to non-experts. This
  fosters trust - the system isn't a black box.
- **Visualizations:** Where possible, use visual aids - e.g., a **strategy map**
  diagram highlighting how initiatives map to goals, a **timeline** for the
  roadmap, charts for metrics. Interactive ones: a user can adjust a slider for
  a forecast assumption and see the graph update in real-time, making the
  strategy exploration more engaging.
- **Empty States & Onboarding:** The first time a user enters a section (say, no
  data ingested yet), we present a friendly explanation and example. E.g. "No
  data yet - upload documents or connect a data source to get started. For
  example, try uploading last quarter's sales report to analyze it." Possibly
  provide sample data for trial. Onboarding tooltips will guide new users
  through main features (but can be skipped).
- **Error States & Recovery:** If something goes wrong (say, retrieval finds
  nothing or a model times out), the UI will show a clear message: e.g. "No
  information found on X, try refining your question" or "Our AI is taking
  longer than expected, you can wait or \[click here\] to retry with a smaller
  scope." We never show raw stack traces to users; errors are phrased in simple
  terms. If a module is down, the UI might degrade gracefully ("Live analysis is
  not available, but you can still browse your data").
- **Real-time Collaboration:** If multiple users are on the platform, we'll show
  presence indicators (like small avatars on the section they're viewing). Live
  edits appear with user color highlights. A history slider or version list can
  let a user revert to an earlier state (like seeing yesterday's strategy draft
  vs today's). We might use a Google Docs-like comment system: highlight text →
  add comment; others can reply or resolve it.
- **Personalization:** Technical users may want more data; we could allow a
  "detailed mode" toggle in preferences that by default shows more info (like
  always show confidence scores, or keep advanced panels open). Non-technical
  might choose a simplified language mode (less jargon, more guidance). The
  system can remember which the user tended to do (if they always expand
  details, perhaps auto-expand by default for them).
- **Delightful Elements:** Small touches can improve UX: e.g. a _chatbot
  assistant_ character that can answer "How do I do X in this tool?" or tooltips
  with examples when hovering over a field. Upon completing a major plan,
  perhaps a brief congratulatory animation or summary of what was achieved.
  These human elements keep users engaged.
- **Accessible Design:** We adhere to WCAG guidelines - use proper HTML
  semantics for screen readers, ensure color choices have sufficient contrast
  (we test with simulators for color blindness, etc.), provide text alternatives
  for any media. Keyboard shortcuts will be available for power users and to
  support those who cannot use a mouse (e.g. navigate through suggestions with
  arrow keys, press Ctrl+Enter to execute a query, etc.). The UI will be tested
  with screen reader software (like NVDA or VoiceOver) to ensure the workflow is
  linear and labels make sense when read aloud.

### Screens / UI Components (Description)

- **Home Dashboard:** Shows recent activity (recent decisions, plans), a big
  "Ask a question" search bar (entry to analysis), and status of the system
  (data last updated, any alerts). Clean, minimal, with quick tips for new
  users.
- **Document Library/Ingestion Page:** A file explorer-like interface for all
  ingested data. Folders (or tags) on left, list of documents with icons (pdf,
  xls, etc.) on right, each with status (indexed or processing). There's an "Add
  Data" button prominent.
- **Analysis Workspace (Q&A view):** A two-column layout - left has either
  questions or outline, right has answer or content. Top has a text query box.
  Answers are formatted nicely with headings, bullet points, and citation
  superscripts. A side panel can slide out with detailed sources when needed.
- **Strategy Editor (for plans):** Looks like a mix of a document editor and a
  project planner. There's a section outline on the left (Goals, Initiatives,
  etc.), the main editor in the middle (rich text, with placeholders the AI can
  fill), and maybe a right sidebar with contextual AI help ("Need help writing
  objectives? Click here.").
- **Decision Log Viewer:** Table of decisions with filters (by date, by project,
  etc.). Selecting one opens a page with all details of that decision (maybe
  similar to a Jira issue page or Confluence doc). It will show context,
  alternatives (perhaps as expandable sections), and outcome if recorded later.
  Possibly a "Compare to previous decision" if superseded (like track changes).
- **Metrics Dashboard:** A page with various charts (line charts for trends, bar
  charts for comparisons). Could resemble a lightweight BI dashboard. The user
  can customize which metrics to show. Alerts or anomalies are highlighted (red
  dots or warning text next to a metric).
- **Risk Matrix:** A color-coded matrix or list of risks. Maybe axes likelihood
  vs impact with points plotted in a quadrant diagram (common risk heatmap). Or
  simply a list grouping High/Med/Low risks with colored tags. Click a risk to
  see mitigation steps and linked plan items.
- **Collaboration & Comments UI:** Possibly a pane or overlay listing all
  comments and discussion threads. Each comment can be resolved or linked to a
  specific content piece. There might also be a "Chat with Team" realtime chat
  for general conversation (though likely they use their own tools for that;
  still, if quick questions about the strategy, having it in context could be
  useful).
- **Settings & Admin UI:** For power users/admins - where they configure
  integrations (APIs, keys), manage users & permissions, view system health
  (maybe a simplified version of observability for admin). This is separate from
  main flow but crucial for enterprise usage.

The design will be modern, web-based, likely a single-page application for
snappy interactions. We'll use a **responsive design** so that viewing a report
or minor interactions can be done on tablet or phone (though heavy editing might
be desktop-focused).

In all, the UX is about making a complex powerhouse _feel simple_. Users get
guided, meaningful outputs quickly, and can always drill down to understand or
adjust the details. This fosters trust and makes the Strategy OS a natural
extension of their workflow, rather than a cumbersome new tool.

## Developer Experience (DX) & Maintainability

To achieve and sustain this ambitious system, we need an excellent developer
experience and rigorous engineering practices. This ensures that as the project
grows (with potentially many contributors, plugins, etc.), development remains
efficient, code quality stays high, and the system is maintainable long-term.
Here's our plan for DX:

**Repo Structure & Code Organization:** We will structure the codebase into
clear **modules** corresponding to the architecture. Likely a monorepo (single
repository) to ease coordinated changes across modules (since they are tightly
integrated), but with each module in its own directory with a well-defined API.
For example:

/ingestion/ - code for ingestion adapters, parsers

/retrieval/ - search index code, query API

/reasoning/ - core logic, LLM interface, chain-of-thought mgmt

/decision/ - decision log management, rules

/ux/ - front-end code (web app)

/common/ - shared libraries (utilities, data models)

Plus separate folders for configs, docs, tests, etc. We'll also have a /plugins/
directory or separate plugin repos (to isolate community contributions if
needed).

Within each module, enforce **cohesion**: e.g., the retrieval module contains
everything related to search (maybe subfolders for "elastic_impl",
"vector_impl", etc.). This modular structure makes it easier for developers to
navigate ("I'm changing retrieval, so I go to that folder").

**Coding Standards:** We will establish a style guide (covering naming,
formatting, etc.) and use linters/formatters to automatically enforce
consistency (e.g., Prettier/ESLint for JS, Black/Flake8 for Python, etc.
depending on language). We'll favor **explicit, readable code** over clever
obfuscation - many contributors will be coming from different backgrounds (AI,
backend, frontend), so clarity is key.

We also adopt **conventional commits** or similar, to keep git history organized
(e.g. prefix commit messages with feat/fix/chore).

**Testing Strategy:** Quality gates demand robust testing:

- **Unit tests:** Every function or small component gets unit tests, especially
  for pure logic pieces. For example, testing that the risk scoring function
  calculates correctly given sample inputs.
- **Property-based testing:** For certain modules, use property tests (e.g. for
  ingestion parsing, given any valid JSON input, output should either parse or
  throw a controlled error, never crash or produce invalid structure). Tools
  like Hypothesis (Python) can help.
- **Integration tests:** Spin up parts of the system together. For instance,
  test that ingest->retrieve->reason loop works end-to-end with a known small
  dataset (like a mini Wikipedia). Verify an expected answer comes out with
  correct citation. Also integration tests for web UI interactions using
  something like Cypress or Selenium (simulate user clicking through a wizard).
- **Load/Performance tests:** Simulate multiple users or large data to ensure
  performance doesn't degrade beyond SLO. This might be separate test suites
  that we run periodically (maybe nightly or on demand, since load tests can be
  heavy).
- **Security tests:** We'll incorporate static analysis (for known vulnerability
  patterns), run dependency scans for CVEs, and if possible fuzz test critical
  interfaces (like the prompt injection possibilities - fuzz the system with
  weird inputs and ensure it responds safely).
- **Continuous testing:** Integrate tests with CI such that on each pull
  request, unit and integration tests must pass, linters must pass, etc., before
  merging (no regressions allowed).

### Documentation & Knowledge Sharing

- We will treat documentation as a first-class artifact. Each module should have
  a **README** explaining its design and usage. The overall project will have a
  docs site (maybe using Sphinx or Docusaurus) covering how to install, how to
  extend, architecture diagrams, API references.
- We'll enforce a rule like: any significant feature PR must come with
  appropriate documentation (either in code comments or user-facing docs).
  Possibly have a **docs gate**: CI fails if a public API changed and docs were
  not updated.
- We will provide **examples** and tutorials in the repo (e.g., a dummy use-case
  walk-through).
- Use docstring standards for any public functions, and maybe generate API docs
  automatically.

### CI/CD Pipeline

- On each PR: run lint, unit tests, build the code, perhaps run a subset of
  integration tests. Also generate an SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) listing
  dependencies (for transparency and compliance).
- Incorporate **security scanning**: e.g. GitHub Dependabot, Snyk or similar to
  catch vulnerable dependencies, plus maybe a secret scanner to ensure no keys
  slip in.
- Use containerization for consistent environment - e.g., docker images for each
  service built on CI and tested (to ensure our deployment artifacts are always
  in a known good state).
- Ensure **reproducible builds**: pin dependencies, use lock files, and use
  deterministic build processes so the same git commit always produces the same
  binary (this aids in trust and debugging).
- **Artifact signing:** We'll use a signing mechanism (like Sigstore cosign or
  similar) so that all release binaries or Docker images are signed, allowing
  users to verify integrity. This would be integrated in CI once tests pass (CI
  signs and publishes).
- Setup a **staging environment** that runs the latest main branch build in a
  sandbox environment (possibly with sample data) - this can be used for final
  integration tests and for PM/QA to do acceptance testing on new features.

**Environments & Branching:** Possibly use trunk-based development with feature
flags (for incomplete features). Or a gitflow with a dev branch. But likely
simpler: everything merges to main behind flags if not ready for users. Release
versions are tagged.

- We can have a nightly build to staging, and manual promotion to prod for SaaS
  or user to download for on-prem.

**Extensibility for Plugins:** We want external developers to easily add modules
(like a new ingestion adapter or a new model route). How to ensure this is easy:

- Provide a **plugin SDK or template**. For example, for ingestion, define an
  abstract class IngestAdapter with methods can_handle(file_type) and
  parse(file); a plugin writer implements this, registers it via entry point.
  Document this pattern clearly with examples (maybe a template repo they can
  fork).
- Keep plugin code **isolated**: either separate repos or at least separate
  namespace so they can be enabled/disabled. Possibly allow plugins to be
  pip-installable packages that our system dynamically loads if present.
- Provide testing harness for plugin devs: e.g. a way to run just the ingestion
  module tests including your new adapter.
- **Compatibility maintenance:** If we change core interfaces, we need to
  version them and support backward compat for a while. Possibly use semantic
  versioning for plugin API: e.g., "Plugin API v1" remains supported until we
  announce deprecation.
- Communication: maintain a plugin registry (maybe in docs or a website) to list
  available community plugins, encouraging contributions.

**Quality & CI Gates:** Aside from tests, we might enforce some code quality
metrics:

- No new code decreases overall test coverage (thus encouraging tests for new
  code).
- Performance budget checks: maybe have a lightweight performance test in CI
  that ensures, say, no request takes > X seconds with dummy data - to catch a
  performance regression early.
- Also, integrate **no regression in eval metrics**: if we have automated
  evaluations for model answers, run them periodically. Perhaps not on each PR
  (too heavy), but on daily/weekly schedule or when releasing. If a change
  reduces a key metric (like groundedness or accuracy beyond a tolerance), don't
  release until addressed.

### Collaboration & Contribution Workflow

- Use issues and discussions to allow devs to ask questions. Maintain a
  CONTRIBUTING.md that explains how to set up dev environment, run tests, coding
  style, etc.
- Possibly use pair programming or code review extensively for knowledge
  transfer. Every PR gets at least one reviewer (ensuring no single dev is
  siloed).
- Use **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)** to document significant design
  decisions. This helps new contributors understand why things were done a
  certain way and avoids re-litigating old decisions without cause. ADRs serve
  as an audit trail for architecture changes (and fits our theme of decisions
  with context).
- We'll set up a continuous integration with multiple environment matrices (e.g.
  test on Linux, Windows, maybe Mac if desktop is a target, and across
  Python/Node versions if applicable) to ensure cross-platform compatibility.

### Maintenance & Evolution

- We plan for **long-term maintainability** by modularity (you can refactor one
  piece with minimal impact on others if interface remains same). We also plan a
  deprecation policy: mark features or APIs as deprecated for one release before
  removal, giving plugin devs/user code time to adjust.
- Use **semantic versioning** for external facing parts (like the SDK) to
  communicate breaking changes clearly.
- Have periodic **code health days** or refactoring sprints where we address
  tech debt, update dependencies, etc., to avoid entropy.
- Track dependencies carefully; update them regularly to get improvements but
  test thoroughly. Use automated tools to monitor if our dependencies themselves
  have new versions or need patches.

In summary, we aim for a **developer-friendly** setup: easy to get running,
clear module boundaries, strong automated checks that give quick feedback, and
thorough documentation. This lowers the barrier for contributors, improves
productivity, and ultimately results in a more reliable system. A happy
development team (or open-source community) that can iterate quickly and safely
will ensure the product remains **frontier-grade** over time, as it can adapt to
new needs and integrate improvements continuously.

## Security, Privacy & Compliance Posture

Building trust in this system means **baking in security and privacy from the
ground up**. We will treat this as an enterprise-grade product with stringent
security controls, aligning with standards (like OWASP, NIST, GDPR/POPIA) to
protect data and ensure compliance. Below is our approach, including threat
modeling and mitigations:

**Threat Model Overview:** Our system handles potentially sensitive business
data. Threats include unauthorized data access (external attacker or insider
abuse), data leakage (through logs or outputs), malicious inputs (attempts to
exploit the system via files or prompt injection), and supply-chain attacks on
our software or models. We also consider reliability threats (DOS attacks, etc.)
under security since they affect availability.

### Authentication & Access Control

- We will integrate with enterprise SSO (OAuth/OIDC, SAML) so that user identity
  is centrally managed. This prevents password management issues and allows
  2FA/MFA via the identity provider.
- Once authenticated, **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** governs actions.
  Define roles like Admin, Analyst, Viewer, etc., with least-privilege
  principles. E.g., only Admins can add new users or configure data sources;
  only certain roles can approve irreversible decisions, etc.
- Possibly support **attribute-based policies** (if needed, e.g., classify some
  documents as confidential and only accessible by users with clearance
  property).
- Sessions will be securely managed (short tokens, inactivity timeouts, refresh
  with rotation).
- **Auditing:** Every access to data or a sensitive action is logged (user X
  viewed doc Y at time Z). These logs go to an audit store that admins can
  review. This not only helps for forensics but deters misuse by insiders.

### Data Security (At-Rest & In-Transit)

- All internal communication will use TLS (even within a local network for
  consistency), ensuring encryption in transit.
- Data at rest: use disk encryption on servers (or rely on cloud-managed
  encryption if deployed in cloud VM), and for the database/indices, enable
  encryption features.
- Especially for user-uploaded files and the knowledge store, we ensure those
  files are stored encrypted (e.g., if using cloud object storage, use
  KMS-managed keys).
- For additional safety, we may allow users to supply their own encryption keys
  (so even we as developers can't read their data if self-hosted).
- Proper key management: encryption keys themselves are stored securely (in key
  vaults or at least environment variables not in code; rotate keys if needed).
- We will not log sensitive content by default. Logging will use IDs or hashes
  to reference data, not raw content. For debugging, we might allow a verbose
  mode but clearly document the risk and for dev use only.

### Input Handling & Sandbox

- The ingestion pipeline will treat all files as potentially hostile. Use
  hardened libraries for parsing (to avoid exploits like malicious PDF or CSV
  formula injection). Possibly run certain parsers in a sandbox process (e.g.,
  use a separate microservice or subprocess that can't touch the rest of the
  system except via a controlled interface).
- Similarly, web content ingestion should sanitize HTML (strip scripts, etc.) if
  the data might be displayed later.
- Prompt injection: Because we use LLMs, an input document could contain text
  that tries to manipulate the LLM's output (like "ignore previous instructions"
  in a doc). We mitigate this by having strong system prompts that reaffirm the
  policy and by possibly preprocessing content to neutralize known injection
  patterns (e.g., break up problematic phrases, or use LLM token metadata to
  prevent it from being interpreted as user instruction).
- We'll maintain a **content security policy** for the UI (if it loads any
  external content, which likely it doesn't except maybe images in docs - but we
  can proxy those to avoid loading remote code).
- If the system supports any plugin execution (like running a Python tool), that
  will be heavily sandboxed with resource limits and no external network unless
  explicitly allowed.

### Supply Chain Integrity

- As discussed, we'll use Sigstore or similar to sign our releases. Users can
  verify signatures to ensure they got genuine code.
- Use dependencies from reputable sources and pin versions. Watch for any that
  could be typosquatting or compromised. Possibly mirror critical dependencies.
- We will follow the emerging frameworks like **SLSA (Supply Chain Levels for
  Software Artifacts)** to incrementally harden our build process (e.g.,
  eventually moving to hermetic builds, verified provenance for artifacts).
- Container images will be scanned for vulnerabilities and minimal (no
  unnecessary packages).
- For models, if we download pre-trained weights, we'll verify checksums and
  prefer official sources (or even host an internal model registry). If a model
  could have been maliciously altered (backdoored), we might not easily detect
  it, so we rely on trusted sources and checks.

### Secure Development & Code

- Develop under **Secure Coding Guidelines** (avoid unsafe functions, validate
  inputs, handle errors carefully).
- Use tools: static analysis (like Bandit for Python, SonarQube etc. for
  general).
- Code reviews will include a checklist item for security implications for new
  code.
- We'll also plan periodic **penetration testing** engagements or use
  open-source pentest tools ourselves to probe the running application
  (especially the web interface and API).
- Setup a bug bounty or responsible disclosure program once public, to get
  external reports on any issue we missed.

### Privacy & Compliance (GDPR, POPIA)

- We adopt "Privacy by Design" - only store personal data if necessary for the
  function. If user uploads a dataset with personal info, we treat it carefully.
  We'll allow features like **PII detection** on ingestion: e.g., automatically
  flag that "This dataset contains emails, names" and prompt the user on how to
  handle it (mask? need consent?).
- Provide **data subject rights** capabilities: e.g., an admin can search for
  all personal data of a user X and delete it (and the system is built such that
  it can do so without breaking integrity). Specifically, GDPR Art.17 and POPIA
  Sec.24 require deletion of personal data when purpose is done or consent
  withdrawn. Our retention policy settings will allow automatic deletion after a
  configurable period if needed.
- **Consent & Lawfulness:** Ensure that any processing of personal data by the
  system is either user-initiated (thus consent) or has some legitimate
  interest. Likely, we'll include in documentation and maybe UI footers that the
  onus is on the user to have rights to the data they input. But we as system
  designers ensure the system can accommodate "do not retain this beyond use" by
  not copying data unnecessarily and by honoring deletion.
- **POPIA specifics:** POPIA is similar to GDPR but specifically, it mandates
  not keeping records longer than needed and requires secure destruction. We
  have covered that with retention policies and secure deletion procedures (like
  wiping out from DB and any backups if applicable). We'll document how an admin
  can configure those policies (e.g. automatic purge of unused data after X
  days).
- If multi-tenant (SaaS), ensure strict data separation between tenants. Each
  tenant's data stored with tenant IDs, queries scoped to that ID, no
  possibility of crossover. Possibly separate encryption keys per tenant to
  further isolate.
- **Data Localization:** Some users might require data stays in certain region
  (especially under POPIA for SA data or GDPR for EU data). Our deployment will
  allow specifying storage location or using their own infrastructure (we
  support on-prem deployment anyway which solves that).

### Monitoring & Incident Response

- Implement continuous security monitoring: e.g., log anomalies (multiple failed
  login attempts -> possible brute force attempt, alert admin). Integrate with
  SIEM tools in enterprise setups.
- Have an incident response plan - if a breach is detected, we know how to
  contain and notify. Logging and audit trails ensure we can forensicly analyze
  what happened.
- Use rate limiting and other measures against DoS or abuse (if public facing,
  ensure an attacker can't spam the analysis queries to exhaust resources; we
  can queue and throttle per user).
- For LLM-specific threats (like someone trying to get the model to output
  another user's data via cleverly crafted prompt), our isolation of user
  sessions and strong context separation ensures model doesn't mix data from
  different sessions. Also, the model won't be allowed to make external
  connections unless via our tools with proper auth (so it can't exfiltrate data
  out by itself).
- If using any third-party services, ensure DPAs (data processing agreements)
  are in place if needed, and that we're not sending personal data to services
  without user's knowledge.

### Compliance Certifications

- While initially internal, aiming for SaaS means we should design towards SOC
  2, ISO 27001, etc. That entails a lot of the above plus documentation and
  processes. We'll begin by implementing those controls from day one (access
  logs, change management records, principle of least privilege in our own dev
  ops, etc.).
- Use something like CIS Benchmarks for our servers/containers to harden
  configurations (close unused ports, minimal OS).
- If any component involves regulated domains (like using it for HR data or
  health data), we would also consider domain-specific compliance (HIPAA, etc.),
  but that might be later. However, our design for privacy should largely cover
  those (like encryption, audit, access control).

### Secure Updates

- We will sign updates as mentioned, and perhaps have the app verify signature
  before applying any self-update to avoid supply chain hijack.
- Also, have a reproducible build for transparency (maybe publish hashes or
  attestation that the build came from our source at commit X, akin to SLSA
  provenance).

**Physical/Infrastructure Security:** If deployed on-prem, that's customer's
domain. For our cloud, we'll use reputable cloud providers, restrict network
(each service runs in private subnet or behind firewall, only necessary ports
open). Data backups, if any, are also encrypted and access controlled. We'll
have disaster recovery for critical data (redundant storage, etc.) to meet
availability targets.

**Summary:** By following these robust controls - from secure coding to
encryption, from RBAC to compliance automation - we ensure the Strategy OS can
be **safely used with sensitive business data**. We'll continuously update our
security measures with emerging threats and do regular audits. Our goal is to
have security and privacy so ingrained that users (and their infosec teams) are
confident in deploying the system for their most critical strategy work.

## Packaging & Deployment

We want to make the Strategy OS accessible in multiple forms to suit different
user preferences: as a web application (which can be SaaS or on-prem), as a
desktop app for individual use, and as a CLI/SDK for automation or integration
into other workflows. Here's how we plan to package and deploy across these
options, ensuring ease of installation and maintenance:

### 1. Web Application (Cloud or On-Prem Server)

- We will containerize the application using Docker (each major component as
  needed, or a single container for simplicity in small deployments). For
  production, we can offer a **Helm chart or Docker Compose** setup that
  launches all required services (web UI, backend, database, vector index,
  etc.).
- **Cloud SaaS:** We'll host a multi-tenant instance in a secure cloud
  environment. Each organization gets its isolated workspace logically. This
  will be the fully managed option.
- **On-Premises:** Provide an installer or deployment scripts to set up on
  customer's servers (maybe an all-in-one Docker image for a quick start, and
  more scalable split images for advanced setups). We'll ensure this process is
  documented and test it on popular platforms.
- Support common platforms (Linux for servers primarily; maybe Windows Server if
  needed for some clients, or use WSL).
- The web app would be accessible via browser at some address. For on-prem,
  we'll support behind firewall installations and custom domain with SSL
  (document how to set up HTTPS via let's encrypt or provide cert).
- **Scaling on-prem:** Document how to scale out if needed (e.g. run multiple
  instances behind a load balancer, or scale DB).
- **Zero or minimal downtime upgrades:** Encourage using blue-green with
  containers. But also our app should handle being upgraded: e.g., provide
  migrations for the database that run automatically when a new version starts
  (but with backup just in case).

### 2. Desktop Application

- Some users (maybe at a small org or for personal use) might want a
  self-contained app on their laptop, offline.
- We can use a framework like **Electron or Tauri** to wrap the web front-end
  and embed a backend server. Essentially, package the entire stack into a
  desktop app that runs locally (with maybe a lightweight DB like SQLite and
  file storage).
- Provide installers for Windows (.exe or MSI), Mac (.dmg), and Linux (.AppImage
  or .deb/rpm). Possibly also distribute via app stores if appropriate.
- One challenge is bundling large models - we might either have the installer
  download needed models on first run (with user consent) to keep installer size
  manageable, or include a small default model and let advanced users add bigger
  ones.
- The desktop app should benchmark machine and possibly advise "you have no GPU,
  large models will be slow, consider connecting to cloud model" and facilitate
  that if user wants.
- Upgrades: Use an auto-update mechanism if possible (Electron supports auto
  updates). Ensure the update process preserves user data (which might be in
  local app data folder or a user-chosen workspace).
- Desktop app will still enforce security (it's single-user typically, but we
  still secure the data on disk and any local web server it uses - binding to
  localhost only).
- The UX would be identical to web, just launched as an app window and with some
  offline/online indicator if it's not connected for any external functions.

### 3. CLI/SDK

- For technical users wanting automation or integration (e.g., incorporate
  strategy generation in CI, or use the system's analysis in their own scripts),
  we will provide a **CLI tool**.
- This CLI would allow key operations: ingest data (e.g. strategyos ingest file1
  file2), ask a question (strategyos query "What should...?"), list decisions,
  export a plan, etc. The output could be text or JSON (with flags to choose
  format), so it can be piped or processed further.
- The CLI can operate in two modes: - **Standalone**: It runs the necessary
  services behind the scenes (if user installed full package). E.g., the first
  time you run it, it might start a local server or load models in memory. This
  is for single-user environments. - **Client to Server**: If the user already
  has the web service running (local or remote), CLI commands can call the
  server's API. We'll support a config for CLI to point to a server URL and API
  key, etc. Then a user could use CLI as a client to their team's deployment.
- We'll also expose a **Python SDK** (since many analysts and data scientists
  use Python), and possibly a REST API or client libs in other languages. The
  SDK would allow doing what UI does: e.g. from strategyos import Client;
  client.query("...") and get structured results. This will help integration
  into Jupyter notebooks or other pipelines.
- Documentation and examples for CLI/SDK usage will be provided (e.g., example:
  schedule a daily run that ingests yesterday's metrics and asks for any
  anomalies).
- Packaging: publish the CLI/SDK via pip (Python) or binary releases on GitHub
  (for those who just want a single static binary, we could compile one for CLI
  if feasible).
- Ensure the CLI has a --help that's very descriptive and maybe even interactive
  prompts to select options if not given.

### One-Command Local Bootstrap

- For evaluation and ease, we'll provide a **dev-mode or trial** script, e.g.
  ./install_and_run.sh or docker run strategyos:latest that spins up everything
  with sample data. This is for someone to quickly see the system working.
- Possibly a pip install strategyos that installs CLI and all, and then
  strategyos launch opens the web UI on localhost.
- Emphasize minimal hardware: define that it can run on a typical laptop (with
  smaller models) albeit slower. For full experience, recommend XYZ resources
  but not mandatory.

### Backup & Restore

- Offer built-in commands or scripts for backup. If using a database for
  decisions/ingested text, instruct how to dump it (e.g. if it's PostgreSQL or
  just backing up certain directories if using file-based).
- For users running on-prem or desktop, document how to enable automatic backups
  (point them to backup the data folder).
- Provide a migration guide for major version changes if data schema changes a
  lot. But ideally, we write migrations in code to auto-apply.
- For SaaS, we handle backups internally (nightly snapshots etc.), but for trust
  we might let customers export their data anytime (so they have their own
  backup).

### Deployment Configurability

- Provide knobs for memory/cpu so on large servers the admin can allocate
  properly (like environment variables for max memory to use for model, etc.).
- Logging config: allow choosing log level, output location (file, syslog,
  etc.).
- For enterprise, container images should support injection of config via env or
  config files (for DB connection, API keys, etc.).
- The system should run fine in air-gapped environment for high-security on-prem
  (we ensure no silent external calls unless configured, and document any
  optional ones like checking for updates or pulling images).

### Update Strategy

- For servers, if using containers, updating is replacing image and running
  migrations. For simpler deployments, maybe we provide an update script.
  Document clearly the steps and mention to backup before upgrade.
- Desktop auto-update we covered (with user consent and ability to defer).
- The CLI/SDK versioning should ideally match server version, but we'll try to
  maintain backward-compatible API so CLI older/newer can still talk to server
  if minor version differences (within reason).
- We might incorporate feature flags to turn on new features gradually (so an
  admin can test before exposing to users - useful for on-prem too).

### Minimal Hardware Profile

- Outline in docs what minimum (e.g., 4 CPU, 8GB RAM, no GPU) can do - maybe
  small scale usage with small models.
- And recommended (16GB+ RAM, a GPU with 10GB memory for heavy LLM tasks). Also
  any OS dependencies (we'll try to bundle all libs in container, but for source
  install maybe need a C compiler for some ML libs, etc.).

By offering flexible packaging options, we ensure the Strategy OS can be adopted
by a wide range of users: those who want a managed cloud solution, those who
need it completely offline internally, or individuals who just want to try it on
their laptop. And crucially, the **deployment and update processes are designed
to be as simple as possible**, because nothing deters adoption like a
complicated setup. A user or admin should be able to get started with minimal
fuss (one command or a quick installer) and trust that updates or migrations
won't break their workflow. This distribution strategy thus supports rapid
uptake and long-term reliability of the system in various contexts.

## Risk Register & Mitigations

No plan is complete without acknowledging risks. We maintain a **risk register**
identifying major risks to the project's success and usage, along with
mitigation strategies. Below are key risks (technical, product, and
organizational) and how we plan to address them:

- **Planning Fallacy (Underestimation of work):** _Risk:_ We might underestimate
  the effort or time to implement features (especially AI aspects), leading to
  delays. _Mitigations:_ Use an agile approach with iterative milestones
  (0-30-60-90 day roadmap as below). Continuously reassess and re-prioritize
  features based on difficulty discovered. Build buffer time into the schedule.
  Also leverage the system's own forecasting to dogfood our planning (why not!).
  Keep stakeholders informed realistically; avoid over-promising exact dates.
- **Scope Creep:** _Risk:_ The vision is broad, there's a danger of feature
  creep (trying to satisfy every possible use case). _Mitigation:_ Stick to core
  deliverables as defined; maintain a clear MVP scope. Use the roadmap to push
  non-core features to later phases. Adopt a plugin mindset for extensions - if
  something is out-of-scope now, note it as future plugin rather than derailing
  current development.
- **Metric Gaming / Goodhart's Law:** _Risk:_ Internally, if we focus on certain
  metrics (like retrieval accuracy, or user satisfaction surveys), team might
  inadvertently optimize at expense of unmeasured qualities. _Mitigation:_ Use a
  balanced scorecard of metrics (as we plan) so no single number is sole success
  criterion. Also conduct qualitative reviews and user interviews to catch
  issues metrics miss.
- **Model Drift and Performance Decay:** _Risk:_ Over time, the models or
  assumptions might become outdated (e.g., economic data changes making past
  causal assumptions invalid), or an open-source model may not perform as well
  on new kinds of queries (concept drift). _Mitigation:_ Implement continuous
  learning: periodically retrain or fine-tune models on new data (with careful
  evaluation before deployment). Monitor outcomes vs predictions; if calibration
  drifts, trigger a review of the models. Keep an eye on new model releases; be
  ready to update the model roster. Also the system's knowledge updating
  processes (monitor if retrieval quality drops meaning maybe content base
  changed distribution).
- **Vendor/API Outage or Change:** _Risk:_ If users rely on optional API (like
  OpenAI) and that service has outage or policy changes, it could disrupt our
  system or cause trust issues. _Mitigation:_ Always have a local model
  fallback, even if quality lower, to ensure continuity. Communicate clearly in
  UI when a plugin service is down and automatically switch to backup. Maintain
  at least two provider options for critical functions (e.g. multiple LLM
  providers pluggable). For API changes (version deprecations), track provider
  deprecation schedules and update our integrations ahead of time.
- **Security Breach:** _Risk:_ A vulnerability could lead to data leak or
  unauthorized access - which would be catastrophic given sensitive data.
  _Mitigation:_ As detailed in security section, implement strong security
  controls and audits. Also establish an incident response process: who handles
  what if breach occurs, how to notify users/regulators within required
  timeframes (especially for GDPR which requires 72h reporting). Regularly
  review the risk register item "security" and update mitigations (like apply
  patches, run new pen tests). Possibly obtain security certifications to
  enforce discipline.
- **User Misuse / Hallucination Damage:** _Risk:_ Users might over-rely on AI
  outputs; a hallucinated recommendation might mislead strategy and cause real
  losses. Also, someone could misuse the system to generate harmful content.
  _Mitigation:_ Emphasize the assistive role: always show evidence and encourage
  user verification. Provide training or tooltips: "Always review sources for
  critical decisions." For hallucination, our groundedness metrics and forcing
  citations are major mitigations. Additionally, include disclaimers for
  predictions ("Forecast is an estimate, not guaranteed"). For harmful content
  misuse, have usage policy and maybe monitoring (for SaaS) to detect obvious
  abuse patterns (like generating hate speech-though our safety layers should
  catch that). Possibly integrate usage logging (with privacy) to detect if the
  system is being used to do something clearly off-policy and have an admin
  intervene.
- **Data Quality Issues:** _Risk:_ If the user's input data is incorrect or
  biased, the outputs will be too (Garbage In, Garbage Out). The system might be
  blamed. _Mitigation:_ Where possible detect anomalies in input (like obviously
  corrupt data, or missing values). Warn the user "Data seems incomplete or
  unusual." Encourage strategies like scenario analysis which can show if
  conclusions hold under different data assumptions. Provide guidance on data
  preparation in docs.
- **Performance/Scaling Issues in Production:** _Risk:_ The system might slow
  down or crash under heavy load (especially early when not battle-tested),
  causing frustration. _Mitigation:_ Prioritize performance testing and
  optimization (we have SLOs and have considered scaling from the start). Deploy
  gradually (canary) to watch for issues. Also include circuit breakers so even
  if one component overloads, it fails gracefully without crashing everything
  (e.g. better to skip a heavy analysis than to hang the entire UI).
- **Lack of Adoption / User Resistance:** _Risk:_ Some users (especially
  non-technical or those used to traditional tools) might resist adopting a new
  system, especially if it seems to automate parts of their job or is complex.
  _Mitigation:_ UX design focusing on being intuitive and clearly beneficial
  (not just fancy). Also allow an incremental adoption: e.g. start by just using
  it as a documentation and decision log tool (with AI suggestions optional) so
  it fits into existing processes, then gradually rely more on AI features as
  trust builds. Provide training materials, webinars, etc. Possibly identify
  champions in teams to advocate usage. And heed user feedback closely to
  improve usability.
- **Regulatory Changes:** _Risk:_ New regulations (AI Act in EU, etc.) might
  impose requirements on transparency, risk management that we need to comply
  with. _Mitigation:_ We're already building explainability which positions us
  well. Remain informed on legal trends. Our governance module can evolve to
  address new compliance (like logging model decisions for external audit).
  Possibly get legal advice or certifications for compliance to reassure users.
- **Open Questions Impacting Design:** We list "Open Questions" as deliverable -
  these unknowns themselves are risks because if answers turn out unfavorable,
  might require pivot. (This will be detailed in next section, but an example:
  if open question is "Will users trust AI in strategic decisions?", if answer
  is no, adoption risk - mitigated by focusing on collaboration and audit
  features as we do.)

Each risk is tracked with an owner on the team and reviewed regularly. We use
the system's own risk & assurance module for this (yes, meta!). By actively
managing these, we aim to preempt issues. And if any occur, we have thought out
contingency plans.

In summary, while there are significant risks in building something this
comprehensive, our approach - agile development, user-centric design, rigorous
security, continuous evaluation - provides a solid mitigation net. The risk
register will evolve, but what matters is a proactive stance: expect issues and
have a plan B or monitoring in place. This way, the project stays resilient and
on track to deliver its value promise.

## Roadmap (0-30-60-90 Days)

We outline a phased roadmap for the next 90 days, focusing on delivering value
early while ensuring we can adjust course based on feedback. Each phase has
specific goals and is designed to be **reversible** if needed (we avoid one-way
dead-ends by validating stepwise).

**Day 0 (Project Start):** We have our requirements and design (as per this
document). Immediate next steps:

- Set up project infrastructure (repo, CI pipeline scaffolding, linters, basic
  structure as per module breakdown).
- Answer any _high-leverage open questions_ (see end of this section) that could
  change design before we lock in too much.

### 0-30 Days (Month 1) - "Minimum Viable Ingestion & QA"

- **Goal:** Deliver a prototype that ingests documents and answers questions
  with sources - the core RAG loop. This is a vertical slice to prove out tech
  and UX fundamentals.
- **Features to Implement:** - Basic **Data Ingestion** for a couple of formats
  (e.g. PDF and CSV) storing content in a simple store (maybe just in-memory or
  SQLite for now). Include provenance capture. - **Knowledge Retrieval** using a
  basic off-the-shelf search (maybe just Elasticsearch or even a simple TF-IDF
  in code to start). Aim for lexical search first as baseline. - **Reasoning
  Engine** initial integration: hook up an open-source LLM (maybe a small one
  like GPT-Neo or even GPT-3 via API to start, depending on what's easiest) to
  generate an answer from retrieved docs. Ensure it cites or quotes them (we can
  enforce via prompt template). - **UI**: Simple web UI where user can upload
  docs and type a question, gets an answer with citations. Very rudimentary but
  functional. Possibly all in one page. - Basic **decision log** stub: maybe not
  fully working, but plan the data model for decisions and have a screen where a
  user manually records a decision (to test that concept, even if AI doesn't
  populate it yet). - Set up initial **evaluation harness**: a few sample Q&A
  pairs to verify correctness, measure groundedness of answers (manually at
  least).
- **Quality Gates for Month 1:** The system should handle e.g. a 10-page PDF and
  answer factual questions from it correctly with cite. No fancy reasoning yet,
  just fact extraction. Also check that the basic security (auth maybe not done
  yet in prototype, that's okay if on local). We do want no crashes with weird
  file input (use try/catch).
- **Deliverable:** Demo to stakeholders (perhaps internal or pilot user)
  showing: "Look, we ingested these docs and our system answered these questions
  with sources."
- **Reversible consideration:** If open question like "is our chosen OS model
  adequate?" gets answered negatively (maybe answers are poor), at 30 days we
  can decide to switch approach (e.g. try a different model or use an API
  temporarily). That's a reversible pivot because our architecture kept model
  abstracted.

### 30-60 Days (Month 2) - "Core Modules & Internal Alpha"

- **Goal:** Expand functionality to cover decision support and planning basics,
  and improve each module per feedback. By end of 60 days, internal team (or
  friendly users) can use the system on real-ish tasks in a closed alpha.
- **Features:** - **Decision Core**: Implement Type1/Type2 logic and the ledger.
  Integrate it with reasoning: e.g., if AI suggests a decision, tag it Type2 by
  default. UI: a decision log page listing decisions; ability to mark decisions
  as approved/implemented or reversed (with basic effect tracking). -
  **Planning/Execution Module**: Implement a simple tree of
  goals->initiatives->tasks. Doesn't have to sync to external tools yet, but
  allow user to define and mark status. Possibly auto-generate a couple tasks
  from an initiative description using AI (low stakes). - **Collaboration
  basics**: Multi-user support in backend with auth (maybe use a simple JWT auth
  with a hardcoded user list or integrate a quick OAuth if easy). Ensure role
  concept exists even if everyone is admin in alpha. This allows testing with a
  small team. - **Observability**: Integrate logging and a basic trace for key
  operations (maybe using OpenTelemetry in code, which we can view in console).
  Not fully UI surfaced but to help dev debug. - **Model improvements**:
  Possibly integrate vector search for better retrieval or a better QA model if
  found. Also implement the Model Gateway abstraction so we can toggle between
  local vs API easily for testing. - **UX improvements**: Start adding
  progressive disclosure - e.g., the answer UI can hide details by default with
  a "show more" that reveals full context or chain-of-thought. Add ability for
  user to give feedback on answer quality (just internally log it) to tune
  later. - **Performance**: Implement caching of embeddings and retrieved
  results to speed up repeated queries. - **Quality & Tests**: Increase
  automated test coverage (cover ingestion edge cases, some integration test of
  a simple decision scenario).
- **By Day 60:** We aim to have an **internal alpha** where a few non-developers
  exercise it on sample workflows (like "upload these docs, produce a SWOT
  analysis", maybe somewhat guided by us because not all features done). We
  gather feedback on usability and refine UX.
- **Risk Checkpoint at 60:** Evaluate key risks discovered so far. For example,
  maybe the open-source LLM is too slow or inaccurate - decide now if we
  integrate a paid API or accelerate fine-tuning. This check is important to
  avoid investing too much in a dead end. Reversible action: if something's not
  working (say, our custom retrieval is poor), we could decide to switch to an
  existing solution like Haystack or Whoosh quickly - mid-course correction.
- Also by 60, finalize plans for what _not_ to include in MVP (descoping if
  needed) so we can focus in last month.

### 60-90 Days (Month 3) - "Beta Launch & Hardening"

- **Goal:** Polish the system for a closed beta with actual end-users or a pilot
  team. Focus on hardening, performance, and compliance.
- **Features:** - **Security & Compliance:** Add SSO integration if needed for
  pilot (or at least basic password auth with roles, plus audit logging of
  actions). Implement data retention settings (maybe simple config). Ensure
  encryption for any sensitive fields in DB. Essentially, all basic security
  features should be in by day 90 for a beta in a real org environment. - **Risk
  & Monitoring:** Implement the risk module's UI (let user define a risk,
  likelihood, etc.) and maybe one auto-risk detection (like flag if no evidence
  for a claim - that could be a "risk: unsupported assertion"). Not full
  continuous monitoring yet, but framework in place. - **UX Polish:** Work on
  empty states (so new users aren't lost), add onboarding tips. Fix any UI
  roughness from alpha feedback (perhaps the workflow needs more guidance or
  clarity). Ensure the design is responsive (test on various screen sizes). -
  **Performance & Scale:** Before beta, run a load test to simulate, say, 5
  concurrent users asking questions on a 100-doc knowledge base. Profile and
  improve any slow parts (maybe add an async queue for LLM calls if blocking,
  etc.). Aim to meet initial p95 latency targets for moderate load. -
  **Packaging:** By day 90, provide an easy install (Docker compose or a simple
  installer script) so beta users can deploy it (if it's on-prem beta). If SaaS
  beta, have the environment set up with proper multi-tenancy separation for
  them. - **Documentation:** Prepare beta documentation: user guide for the
  features available, known limitations. Also admin guide if they install it.
  Update our internal docs for any changes since design. - **Evaluation:**
  Conduct a formal evaluation on some test questions and decisions, report
  metrics (like, groundedness average, decision rationale completeness %).
  Ensure we hit the quality gates set for this stage (maybe not 95% on
  everything yet but see improvement from month1).
- **Day 90 Milestone:** Beta release. A handful of actual end-users use the
  system on their use cases. We provide support, gather feedback systematically
  (UI issues, missing features, confusing things, etc.).
- We also finalize the backlog for post-90 (which features that we postponed
  must be done for GA, vs which can wait). For instance, maybe we decided in
  risk that forecasting isn't fully done by 90, that's okay if not needed in
  beta; but must plan for it later.
- **Reversibility:** By designing these milestones, each one delivers a working
  increment. If something fundamentally is disliked in beta (e.g., users hate
  the UI flow for decisions), we can revise UI (which is easier than deep
  backend change). Or if an AI component isn't reliable, we can toggle it off
  (feature flag) and let users do more manual with logging, then improve model
  for GA - that's reversible in that we can temporarily fall back to more manual
  function while fixing AI.

After 90 days, assuming beta is positive, we'll plan the next steps towards a
production-ready v1. That might include more integrations (PM tools, etc.), more
robust forecasting, fine-tuning the models, etc., likely another 90-day cycle or
so for GA.

Throughout 0-90, we keep the **open questions** in mind and try to answer them
as soon as information is available, since their answers can significantly
change priorities or design. Now, to explicitly list those open questions
(deliverable 13):

## Open Questions (High-Leverage)

Despite our thorough plan, certain uncertainties remain. These are
**high-leverage questions** - the answers could substantially influence the
design or direction. We will prioritize finding answers or making decisions on
these early, as they have the greatest impact:

- **User Trust and Interaction:** _To what extent will end-users trust
  AI-generated strategy suggestions, and how much transparency do they need to
  accept them?_ If users are very skeptical, we might need even more extensive
  explainability UIs or to design the system to focus on augmentation over
  automation. We plan user interviews in the beta phase to gauge this. This
  affects how autonomous vs assistive the AI should be.

- **Open-Source Model Performance:** _Can open-source LLMs (e.g., fine-tuned
  LLaMA or others) deliver the required quality for complex reasoning, or do we
  need to rely on a proprietary model for key tasks?_ This will be answered via
  evaluation in month 1-2. If open models fall short, we might integrate an API
  for quality and plan to transition later when OSS catches up or fine-tune
  extensively. It impacts cost, offline capability, and development effort on
  model side.

- **Scaling Limits:** _What are the practical limits of our design on commodity
  hardware vs enterprise?_ E.g., how many documents or what document length
  before retrieval quality degrades or latency spikes? This empirical question
  will be tested. If limits are low, we need strategies like chunking,
  summarization, or more powerful infra for larger scales. This influences
  architecture choices (distributed index sooner? summarization pipeline?).

- **Primary User Persona:** _Which user type yields the most value initially -
  non-technical business strategists or data-savvy analysts?_ If the former, we
  emphasize simple UI and guidance; if the latter, we might expose more advanced
  controls/SDK early. Both are in scope, but which to optimize first is key for
  adoption. We'll get this answer via early pilot feedback or market research.

- **Integration Needs:** _How critical is integration with existing tools
  (Excel, Jira, PowerBI, etc.) for adoption?_ If pilots insist they must plug
  into existing workflows, we may prioritize those connectors in roadmap. If
  they're happy using our interface and just exporting reports, then connectors
  can come later. This affects development focus (embedding into ecosystems vs
  standalone value).

- **Data Governance Requirements:** _Do target organizations require strict
  on-prem only operation due to data sensitivity?_ If yes for most, our on-prem
  packaging and ease-of-use there becomes top priority; if many are okay with
  cloud, SaaS path might accelerate. Also, if they need things like audit trails
  integrated with their systems, we might prioritize compliance features even
  more. We'll answer by engaging with potential early customers' IT/security
  teams.

- **Extent of Automated Planning:** _Will users trust the system to not only
  suggest but also schedule and update tasks automatically in PM tools?_ This
  gauges how far to go with execution automation. If yes (they want autopilot
  mode), we design robust sync and maybe autonomous adjustments. If no, we focus
  on providing recommendations and let users manually confirm actions. This
  affects complexity of Execution Spine we implement.

- **Regulatory Outlook for AI Decisions:** _Are there upcoming regulations (like
  EU AI Act) that would classify our tool as high-risk (since it aids
  decisions)?_ If likely, we should incorporate required features (e.g., more
  extensive logging, human oversight checkpoints) from get-go to future-proof.
  We'll keep an eye via legal advisors. This could influence how we frame the
  product (decision support vs decision maker).

- **Open Contribution Model:** _How engaged will the open-source community be in
  extending this?_ If initial interest is high, we should invest in making
  plugin development and community processes smooth early on (even before GA).
  If low (maybe users just want product), we allocate less to managing external
  contributions early and focus core. This we'll learn by open-sourcing early
  components and gauging response.

- **Performance of CRDT/Collab Engine:** _Can our chosen approach (likely CRDT)
  handle real-time collaboration with potential large documents (like a 50-page
  strategy) without lag?_ If we find technical challenges here, we might
  simplify collaboration (maybe lock sections for editing rather than true
  real-time merging) as a temporary measure. So testing CRDT at scale is needed.
  Outcome could alter the complexity of collaboration feature initially.

Each of these questions is tied to either a validation step in our roadmap or a
decision point. By addressing them head-on (through prototyping, testing with
users, researching industry trends), we can steer the project wisely. The ones
that could change the design significantly (like model performance or user trust
level) are investigated in the first 30-60 days so that any major pivots (like
integrating a different model or changing UX approach) can be done with minimal
wasted work.

By delivering on this - and by being agile in answering open questions and
mitigating risks - we aim to develop a **Strategy OS** that truly meets the
"frontier-grade" vision: an open, intelligent platform that transforms how
organizations craft and execute strategy, with confidence and clarity every step
of the way.

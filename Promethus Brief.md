# Promethus Brief

## Executive Summary

Organisations today need a "strategy OS" an intelligent system that can
turn messy, heterogeneous inputs (documents, data, domain knowledge) into
defensible, evidence-linked strategy and execution plans. The mandate is to
design this system OSS-first (open source by default, with optional paid
plug-ins) and frontier-grade across all key dimensions: accuracy/truthfulness,
latency/throughput, robustness and safety, observability, security/compliance,
maintainability, and UX/DX. In other words, it must rival or exceed the state of
the art (including proprietary systems) on every front. The value proposition is
substantial: any organisation from a startup on a laptop to an enterprise on a
cluster could make high-stakes decisions grounded in data and rigorous
reasoning, with full explainability and auditability. For example, ISO 9001:2015
quality management highlights evidence-based decision-making as a core
principle, since "without relying on facts, decisions can only be correct by
sheer luck," whereas decisions based on analysed data "significantly increase
the probability of achieving desired results." By leveraging the latest in
open-source AI/ML, knowledge management, and software engineering, this Strategy
OS will enable organisations to respond to complex challenges with speed
(through automation and AI assistance), trustworthiness (through evidence-linked
rationale and compliance controls), and adaptability (through modular,
extensible design).

## What "good" looks like

Success means the system produces decisions and plans that are explainable,
auditable, and effective. Every major decision should come with a transparent
rationale (linked to source evidence and explicit assumptions), alternative
options considered (with forecasted outcomes), and a record in an immutable
decision log. The quality of decisions should improve over time for example,
forecasting calibration error (Brier score) decreasing as the system learns, and
no significant "unknown unknowns" left unprobed. Users (both non-technical and
experts) should report high satisfaction, with faster time-to-insight and
confidence that the recommendations are reliable. Critically, the system must
enforce rigorous quality gates: for instance, no strategic recommendation is
finalised unless it is grounded in the knowledge base (with citations), and no
execution plan passes review unless risk checks, compliance (GDPR/POPIA), and
quality metrics are green-lit. In sum, the Strategy OS will serve as a "second
brain" for organisations ingesting and filtering information, reasoning over it
like a team of analysts, and outputting well-structured strategies with the
evidence, reasoning, and contingencies clearly laid out. This document presents
a comprehensive plan covering the capability stack, architecture, model
strategy, performance, UX, DX, and more all designed to meet that north star
of an open, intelligent, and frontier-grade strategy co-pilot for businesses.

    ```

- **Ingestion to knowledge:** Inputs are normalised with provenance before
  indexing for retrieval.
- **Retrieval to reasoning:** Hybrid retrieve-then-read patterns iterate until
  sufficient evidence is found.
- **Reasoning to decision:** Recommendations flow into the decision core where
  criticality, approvals, and ledger entries are handled.
- **Decision to execution:** Approved strategies become work breakdowns synced
  to delivery tools with idempotent updates.
- **Monitoring feedback:** Outcomes, metrics, and incidents loop back into
  reasoning for continuous learning and risk adaptation.

## Plugin Architecture & Isolation

Modules communicate via well-defined contracts (gRPC/REST or typed events).
Plugins declare subscribed and emitted event types, required permissions, SLA
expectations, and failure modes. Isolation is achieved by running plugins in
sandboxes or separate processes so faults do not cascade. The architecture
supports both lightweight single-machine deployments and scalable clustered
setups via auto-configuration based on detected hardware (CPU, GPU, memory).

## Provider & Model Strategy (OSS-first, Cloud-Smart)

A unified model gateway abstracts all AI model calls. It handles routing,
ensembling, monitoring, and fallback across open-weight models and optional
managed APIs. Key principles include:

- **Open-source first:** Prefer local OSS checkpoints for cost, control, and
  privacy, integrating proprietary APIs only when necessary.
- **Task-specific routing:** Select models based on task type (generation,
  extraction, embeddings, reranking) and live telemetry for latency, cost, and
  quality.
- **Continuous benchmarking:** Maintain eval suites (grounded QA, reasoning,
  domain tasks) to score models and inform routing decisions.
- **Safety controls:** Apply pre-flight scans, output filters, and automatic
  retries to enforce policy and prevent hallucinations or disallowed content.
- **Provider resilience:** Design for stateless usage, rate limiting, cost caps,
  and graceful degradation when external services fail.

## Evaluation & Quality Gates

Quality gates ensure the system remains frontier-grade across functionality,
robustness, and compliance.

- **Retrieval relevance:** Hybrid search must outperform lexical baselines by
  > 20% on Recall@5, with 95% citation accuracy in sampled outputs.
- **Reasoning groundedness:** Groundedness scores target 0.7 for 90% of
  answers with no critical hallucinations; TruthfulQA performance should be in
  the top decile of evaluated models.
- **Decision auditability:** 7 95% of sampled decisions require complete
  context, alternatives, and rationale; Type 2 decisions include scheduled
  reviews.
- **Evidence linkage:** Critical causal links are backed by citations or
  explicit assumptions; no orphan outcome nodes in theories of change.
- **Forecast calibration:** Brier scores improve quarter-over-quarter; calibration
  error remains below 0.1 per probability bin.
- **Metric balance:** Simulated strategies must avoid catastrophic trade-offs;
  each KPI has a counter-metric or qualitative check.
- **Risk responsiveness:** >90% of simulated threshold breaches trigger alerts
  within defined SLAs; each high-priority risk has owner and mitigation.
- **User experience:** Time-to-first-insight <30s p95 for standard analyses;
  task completion rate >90% in usability tests; accessibility scans report zero
  critical WCAG violations.
- **Safety:** No policy violations in adversarial red-team tests; stress tests
  demonstrate graceful degradation without crashes.
- **Security:** Zero high-severity vulnerabilities at release, verified deletion
  flows for GDPR/POPIA requests, no PII in logs.
- **Observability:** End-to-end traces captured for 95% of transactions, slow
  path exemplars logged with root-cause annotations.

## Performance, Scale & Cost Plan

Set service-level objectives while planning for automatic configuration and
scalability.

- **Target SLOs:** Ingestion p95 <10s for 100-page documents, retrieval p95
  <200ms on 100k docs, reasoning p95 <5s for routine queries, end-to-end p95 <5s
  for typical workflows.
- **Auto-benchmarking:** On startup, benchmark hardware to select appropriate
  models, quantisation levels, concurrency, and caching policies.
- **Scalability modes:** Operate on a single machine or scale out with
  microservices, horizontal sharding, autoscaling queues, and GPU pooling.
- **Zero-downtime updates:** Use canary releases, blue-green deployments, and
  backwards-compatible contracts.
- **Optimisation playbook:** Cache embeddings and results, batch model calls,
  stream partial outputs, use quantised inference, and profile regularly.
- **Cost management:** Track external API usage, support budget caps, scale down
  idle resources, and prefer efficient models for sustained workloads.
- **Error budgets:** Monitor SLO adherence and trigger incident response when
  error budgets are exhausted.

## User Experience (UX) & Interface

Design for clarity, progressive disclosure, and collaboration across diverse
user personas.

- **Key journeys:** Document ingestion to brief generation, hypothesis validation
  to causal plan, option comparison to decision log, and plan syncing to
  execution tracking.
- **Assistive UI:** Wizards, templates, and contextual AI assistant panels guide
  users through complex workflows without overwhelming them.
- **Explainability:** Every AI-generated element offers "explain" affordances
  with citations, assumptions, and optional chain-of-thought views.
- **Collaboration:** Real-time presence indicators, CRDT co-editing, comments,
  and version history support multi-user work.
- **Error handling:** Friendly messages, recovery options, and degraded modes
  maintain trust under failure.
- **Accessibility:** Semantic markup, keyboard shortcuts, high-contrast themes,
  and localisation ensure inclusive experiences.

## Developer Experience (DX) & Maintainability

A disciplined engineering workflow keeps the system evolvable.

- **Repo structure:** Stage-specific directories (`ingestion/` ... `monitoring/`),
  shared libraries in `common/`, optional extensions in `plugins/`.
- **Coding standards:** Enforce linters, formatters, and conventional commits for
  consistency and clear history.
- **Testing:** Apply unit, property, integration, load, and security tests, with
  CI gating merges on passing suites.
- **Documentation:** Maintain READMEs per module, autogenerated API docs, and
  ADRs for significant design decisions.
- **CI/CD:** Run lint/test/security scans, build signed artefacts, publish SBOMs,
  and deploy to staging environments for verification.
- **Plugin SDK:** Provide templates, stable interfaces, and testing harnesses for
  community extensions.
- **Maintainability:** Adopt semantic versioning, deprecation policies, and
  scheduled refactoring to control technical debt.

## Security, Privacy & Compliance Posture

Security and privacy are foundational, aligning with OWASP, NIST, GDPR/POPIA,
and supply chain best practices.

- **Authentication & access:** Integrate SSO, enforce RBAC with least privilege,
  log all sensitive actions, and support attribute-based policies if required.
- **Data protection:** Encrypt in transit and at rest, manage keys securely, and
  avoid logging sensitive content.
- **Sandboxing:** Harden ingestion parsers, sandbox untrusted code, and mitigate
  prompt injection via robust system prompts and preprocessing.
- **Supply chain:** Sign artefacts (Sigstore/cosign), pin dependencies, adopt
  SLSA practices, and scan containers for vulnerabilities.
- **Secure development:** Use static analysis, secure code reviews, penetration
  testing, and responsible disclosure paths.
- **Privacy controls:** Detect PII, honour deletion requests, enforce retention
  policies, and support tenant isolation with per-tenant keys.
- **Monitoring & response:** Employ SIEM integrations, rate limiting, incident
  runbooks, and regulatory notification workflows.
- **Regulatory readiness:** Track emerging regulations (e.g. EU AI Act) and
  adjust governance modules to meet required transparency and oversight.

## Packaging & Deployment

Offer flexible distribution models to meet diverse deployment needs.

- **Web application:** Containerised services with Docker/Helm for SaaS or
  on-prem, supporting horizontal scaling and secure multi-tenancy.
- **Desktop application:** Electron/Tauri packaging for offline single-user
  scenarios with auto-updates and local storage safeguards.
- **CLI/SDK:** Command-line tooling and language SDKs (Python, REST) for
  automation and integration, operating standalone or as clients to deployed
  servers.
- **One-command bootstrap:** Provide quickstart scripts or docker-compose
  bundles with sample data for rapid evaluation.
- **Backup & restore:** Document database/file backups, migrations, and disaster
  recovery procedures.
- **Configuration:** Expose environment-driven tuning for resources, logging,
  and integrations, including air-gapped operation.
- **Update strategy:** Support rolling upgrades, feature flags, and semantic
  versioning across artefacts.

## Risk Register & Mitigations

Track strategic and operational risks with owners and mitigation plans.

1. **Planning fallacy:** Mitigate via iterative roadmap checkpoints, buffer time,
   and continuous estimation.
2. **Scope creep:** Enforce MVP boundaries, leverage plugin model for extras,
   and review roadmap regularly.
3. **Metric gaming:** Use balanced scorecards and qualitative reviews.
4. **Model drift:** Monitor outcomes, retrain as needed, and refresh model
   rosters.
5. **Vendor outages:** Maintain local fallbacks and communicate degradations.
6. **Security breaches:** Apply defence-in-depth, audits, and incident response
   drills.
7. **Hallucination damage:** Require citations, highlight uncertainty, and offer
   human review checkpoints.
8. **Data quality:** Detect anomalies, warn users, and encourage scenario
   testing.
9. **Performance bottlenecks:** Stress test, profile, and implement backpressure
   and circuit breakers.
10. **User adoption:** Deliver intuitive UX, training, and incremental rollout
    paths.
11. **Regulatory change:** Stay informed, adapt governance features, and consult
    legal advisors.

    unknowns early.

## Roadmap (0->30->60->90 Days)

Deliver in reversible, value-focused increments.

- **Day 0 setup:** Establish repo, CI scaffolding, and clarify high-leverage open
  questions.
- **0->30 days (MVP ingestion & QA):** Implement ingestion for key formats,
  baseline retrieval, initial reasoning with cited answers, simple UI, and
  evaluation harness. Demonstrate vertical slice.
- **30->60 days (core modules & alpha):** Add decision core, planning spine,
  basic collaboration, observability instrumentation, improved model gateway,
  caching, and expanded tests. Run internal alpha and gather feedback.
- **60->90 days (beta & hardening):** Harden security, retention, risk module,
  UX polish, performance optimisation, packaging scripts, documentation, and
  formal evaluations. Launch closed beta and capture lessons for GA.

## Open Questions (High-Leverage)

1. **User trust:** What transparency is required for stakeholders to rely on AI
   recommendations?
2. **Model adequacy:** Do open-source LLMs meet quality targets or is proprietary
   fallback necessary for key workloads?
3. **Scaling limits:** How large can corpora grow on commodity hardware before
   performance or relevance degrades?
4. **Primary persona:** Should UX optimise first for non-technical strategists
   or data-savvy analysts?
5. **Integration demand:** Which external tool connectors are critical for early
   adoption?
6. **Data governance:** What proportion of target users require strictly on-prem
   deployments and advanced compliance features?
7. **Automation appetite:** How far should execution automation go before users
   feel loss of control?
8. **Regulatory outlook:** How will AI governance regulations classify strategy
   automation tools and what controls are mandatory?
9. **Community engagement:** How much effort should go into plugin ecosystem
   support early on?
10. **Collaboration scalability:** Can CRDT-based editing handle long strategic
    documents without latency issues?

---

By delivering on this plan and adapting as open questions are answered the
Strategy OS aims to become an open, intelligent, frontier-grade platform that
turns heterogeneous knowledge into defensible, auditable, and actionable
strategies for organisations of every size.

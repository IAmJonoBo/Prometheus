# Tests

This directory mirrors the pipeline and houses unit, integration, and
end-to-end coverage to enforce Prometheus quality gates.

## Structure

- `unit/` (TBD) — Stage-specific unit tests grouped by module.
- `integration/` (TBD) — Cross-stage event flow validations using fixtures.
- `e2e/` (TBD) — Golden scenarios replaying the full pipeline.
- `plugins/` (TBD) — Contract tests for optional extensions.

## Testing guidance

- Co-locate fixtures with tests; use synthetic data that reflects masking
  requirements and provenance metadata.
- For integration suites, focus on schema compatibility and observability
  signals (metrics, traces).
- End-to-end runs should assert decision ledger entries, execution sync, and
  monitoring alerts remain consistent with approved baselines.
- Record test plans and coverage expectations in `docs/quality-gates.md`.

## Tooling

- Adopt `pytest` (Python) and `vitest`/`jest` (TypeScript) as primary harnesses
  when implementations land.
- Provide makefile or task runner targets for each suite (TBD in tooling plan).
- Ensure CI emits artefacts (coverage, logs) for audit trails.

## Backlog

- Scaffold directory structure with placeholder `__init__.py`/`package.json`
  files once language stacks are confirmed.
- Publish sample fixtures drawn from the product brief.
- Integrate tests with pre-commit/CI pipelines defined in `.github/workflows/`.

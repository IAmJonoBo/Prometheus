PROBLEM STATEMENT REQUIREMENTS
================================================================================

✅ Investigate relevant comments and TODOs
   - Reviewed PRE_PACKAGING_USAGE.md "Next Steps"
   - Reviewed TODO-refactoring.md for E2E test requirements
   - Reviewed quality-gates.md for testing requirements

✅ Integrate with existing CLI commands
   - Policy configuration integrates with DecisionService
   - Monitoring configuration integrates with MonitoringService
   - Configurations loaded via PrometheusConfig.load()
   - CLI commands already support config files

✅ Add configuration for policies
   - Created comprehensive policies.toml
   - Defined approval thresholds
   - Configured risk assessment
   - Set audit requirements
   - Added environment overrides

✅ Set up continuous monitoring
   - Created comprehensive monitoring.toml
   - Configured collectors and dashboards
   - Set alerting thresholds
   - Defined health checks
   - Configured SLO tracking

✅ Extend e2e tests with real integrations
   - Created comprehensive E2E test suite
   - Added policy enforcement tests
   - Added monitoring integration tests
   - Added auto-sync workflow tests
   - Added cross-repo coordination tests
   - Added ML risk prediction tests

✅ Set quality gates for tests
   - Enhanced quality-gates.md with validation commands
   - Created validation script
   - Defined test coverage requirements
   - Documented release criteria
   - Created release readiness checklist

================================================================================
NEXT STEPS FOR FULL PRODUCTION RELEASE
================================================================================

1. CI Integration (Priority: High)
   - Add quality gates to GitHub Actions
   - Configure E2E test execution in CI
   - Set up coverage reporting

# UX

The UX layer delivers collaborative decision workspaces with accessibility and
governance cues baked in. Implementation is still on the roadmap; this
document captures the design goals that guide future work.

## Responsibilities

- Provide decision rooms with shared context, live drafting, and evidence
  pinning.
- Support CRDT-backed co-editing, presence, and comment threads.
- Enforce WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility and localisation readiness.
- Surface guardrail states, approvals, and execution status to users.

## Integration points

- Consumes telemetry and status updates from `monitoring/` and `execution/`.
- Presents evidence bundles from `retrieval/` and rationale from `decision/`.
- Emits user feedback signals captured by monitoring and product analytics.

## Frontend architecture (TBD)

- Likely React/TypeScript SPA with offline support and service workers.
- State synchronisation via CRDT layer (e.g., Automerge/Yjs) and WebSocket
  transport.
- Accessibility testing via axe-core and keyboard navigation suites.

## Backlog

- Define component library and theming strategy (light/dark, high contrast).
- Document UX telemetry schema in `docs/ux.md` and `docs/performance.md`.
- Build design tokens and hand-off process with DesignOps once team in place.

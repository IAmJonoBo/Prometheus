- Selectively query humans for high-impact labels
- Minimize annotation burden

#### Multi-Modal Analysis
- Images, audio, video in addition to text
- Cross-modal retrieval and reasoning

## Implementation Principles

When considering enhancements:

1. **Opt-In Complexity** - Advanced features should be optional, not mandatory
2. **OSS-First** - Prefer open-source over proprietary when feasible
3. **Privacy-Preserving** - Default to local/private; cloud is opt-in
4. **Extensible** - Build platforms, not features; enable plugins
5. **Observable** - Instrument everything for debugging and improvement
6. **Tested** - New features require tests and documentation
7. **Documented** - Update ADRs for architectural changes

---

## Prioritization Process

Enhancements move from this document to the roadmap via:

1. **Community Input** - GitHub discussions, issues, surveys
2. **Feasibility Analysis** - Technical spike, effort estimate
3. **Value Assessment** - User impact, strategic alignment
4. **ADR Creation** - Document decision and trade-offs
5. **Roadmap Addition** - Commit to timeline and owner

---

## Deprecation & Removal

Features may be deprecated and eventually removed if:
- Low/no usage (telemetry-driven)
- High maintenance burden
- Better alternatives available
- Security concerns unresolved

**Deprecation Policy**:
1. Mark deprecated in docs and runtime warnings
2. Maintain for at least 2 major versions
3. Provide migration guide
4. Remove after notice period

# Next Steps

## Tasks
- [ ] Deliver Temporal worker implementations plus Prometheus/Grafana
   dashboards wired to OTLP exporters for end-to-end observability. *(Owner:
   Platform, Due: 2025-02-15)*
- [ ] Expose ingestion scheduler and PII masking metrics, validate
   configuration under load, and extend coverage with integration tests
   against live services. *(Owner: Data Pipeline, Due: 2025-01-31)*
- [ ] Wire the retrieval regression harness into CI with seeded corpora and
   publish evaluation dashboards that gate releases. *(Owner: Retrieval, Due:
   2025-02-07)*
- [ ] Implement real ingestion connectors and persistence for normalised
   documents.
- [ ] Extend retrieval adapters with hybrid search backends and reranking.
- [ ] Replace in-memory execution and monitoring shims with external system
   integrations and telemetry exporters.

## Steps
- [x] Establish baseline test, lint, type-check, security, and build results
   for the current branch.
- [x] Instrument ingestion scheduler telemetry and redaction metrics,
   propagate them through monitoring signals, and document configuration
   validation behaviour.
- [x] Draft Temporal worker skeletons plus dashboard scaffolding once
   ingestion metrics land.
- [ ] Automate retrieval regression harness execution in CI after
   observability enhancements ship.
- [ ] Exercise the Temporal worker plan and dashboard exports against a live
   stack to validate connectivity and schema compatibility.

## Deliverables
- Ingestion metrics surfaced via monitoring collectors and documented
   configuration validation guardrails.
- Temporal worker adapters and Grafana dashboards wired to OTLP exporters.
- CI job executing retrieval regression harness with published dashboards.

## Quality Gates
- Tests: `pytest` green.
- Lint: `ruff check .` clean.
- Type-check: `pyright` with optional dependency suppressions or stubs; no
   blocking diagnostics.
- Security: `pip-audit` passes or has a documented network limitation.
- Build: `poetry build` succeeds.
- Coverage: â‰¥85% branch coverage on ingestion and monitoring modules (stretch
   until tooling lands).

## Links
- Current checks: pytest (`cac496`), ruff (`fab962`), pyright (`848f2d`),
   `pip-audit` (`9c9668`), poetry build (`c396cd`).

## Risks / Notes
- Optional dependencies (`temporalio`, `opentelemetry`, `qdrant`,
   `sentence-transformers`) are not installed in CI images; type-checking
   emits missing import diagnostics until stubs or conditionals are added.
- `pip-audit` currently fails due to SSL verification against `pypi.org`;
   re-run once certificates are available.
- Retrieval harness requires seeded corpora and evaluation dashboard stack;
   scoping is ongoing.

# Prometheus

Prometheus is an OSS-first, modular, event-driven strategy OS for evidence-linked decision automation. This project is structured into core pipeline modules (ingestion, retrieval, reasoning, decision, execution, monitoring), with support for plugins, unified model gateway, and robust developer experience. 

## Architecture
- **Pipeline:** Ingestion → Retrieval → Reasoning → Decision → Execution → Monitoring
- **Plugins:** Isolated, auto-configured, hardware-aware
- **Retrieval:** Hybrid (lexical + vector + rerankers)
- **Model Gateway:** Open-weight models, optional APIs
- **Security:** SSO, RBAC, encryption, PII detection, supply-chain hygiene
- **Packaging:** SaaS, on-prem, desktop, CLI, SDK
- **Collaboration:** CRDT-backed, WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility
